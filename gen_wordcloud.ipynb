      "\n",
      "In the literature of all countries there will be found a certain number\n",
      "of works treating especially of love. Everywhere the subject is dealt\n",
      "with differently, and from various points of view. In the present\n",
      "publication it is proposed to give a complete translation of what is\n",
      "considered the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, and which\n",
      "is called the 'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' or Aphorisms on Love, by\n",
      "Vatsyayana.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the introduction will bear with the evidence concerning the date\n",
      "of the writing, and the commentaries written upon it, the chapters\n",
      "following the introduction will give a translation of the work itself.\n",
      "It is, however, advisable to furnish here a brief analysis of works of\n",
      "the same nature, prepared by authors who lived and wrote years after\n",
      "Vatsya had passed away, but who still considered him as a great\n",
      "authority, and always quoted him as the chief guide to Hindoo erotic\n",
      "literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the treatise of Vatsyayana the following works on the same\n",
      "subject are procurable in India:--\n",
      "\n",
      "     1. The Ratirahasya, or secrets of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "     2. The Panchasakya, or the five arrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "     3. The Smara Pradipa, or the light of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "     4. The Ratimanjari, or the garland of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "     5. The Rasmanjari, or the sprout of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "     6. The Anunga Runga, or the stage of love; also called\n",
      "          Kamaledhiplava, or a boat in the ocean of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author of the 'Secrets of Love' (No. 1) was a poet named Kukkoka. He\n",
      "composed his work to please one Venudutta, who was perhaps a king. When\n",
      "writing his own name at the end of each chapter he calls himself \"Siddha\n",
      "patiya pandita,\" _i.e._, an ingenious man among learned men. The work\n",
      "was translated into Hindi years ago, and in this the author's name was\n",
      "written as Koka. And as the same name crept into all the translations\n",
      "into other languages in India, the book became generally known, and the\n",
      "subject was popularly called Koka Shastra, or doctrines of Koka, which\n",
      "is identical with the Kama Shastra, or doctrines of love, and the words\n",
      "Koka Shastra and Kama Shastra are used indiscriminately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work contains nearly eight hundred verses, and is divided into ten\n",
      "chapters, which are called Pachivedas. Some of the things treated of in\n",
      "this work are not to be found in the Vatsyayana, such as the four\n",
      "classes of women, viz., the Padmini, Chitrini, Shankini and Hastini, as\n",
      "also the enumeration of the days and hours on which the women of the\n",
      "different classes become subject to love. The author adds that he wrote\n",
      "these things from the opinions of Gonikaputra and Nandikeshwara, both of\n",
      "whom are mentioned by Vatsyayana, but their works are not now extant. It\n",
      "is difficult to give any approximate idea as to the year in which the\n",
      "work was composed. It is only to be presumed that it was written after\n",
      "that of Vatsyayana, and previous to the other works on this subject that\n",
      "are still extant. Vatsyayana gives the names of ten authors on the\n",
      "subject, all of whose works he had consulted, but none of which are\n",
      "extant, and does not mention this one. This would tend to show that\n",
      "Kukkoka wrote after Vatsya, otherwise Vatsya would assuredly have\n",
      "mentioned him as an author in this branch of literature along with the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author of the 'Five Arrows' (No. 2 in the list) was one Jyotirisha.\n",
      "He is called the chief ornament of poets, the treasure of the sixty-four\n",
      "arts, and the best teacher of the rules of music. He says that he\n",
      "composed the work after reflecting on the aphorisms of love as revealed\n",
      "by the gods, and studying the opinions of Gonikaputra, Muladeva,\n",
      "Babhravya, Ramtideva, Nundikeshwara and Kshemandra. It is impossible to\n",
      "say whether he had perused all the works of these authors, or had only\n",
      "heard about them; anyhow, none of them appear to be in existence now.\n",
      "This work contains nearly six hundred verses, and is divided into five\n",
      "chapters, called Sayakas or Arrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author of the 'Light of Love' (No. 3) was the poet Gunakara, the son\n",
      "of Vechapati. The work contains four hundred verses, and gives only a\n",
      "short account of the doctrines of love, dealing more with other\n",
      "matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Garland of Love' (No. 4) is the work of the famous poet Jayadeva,\n",
      "who said about himself that he is a writer on all subjects. This\n",
      "treatise is, however, very short, containing only one hundred and\n",
      "twenty-five verses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author of the 'Sprout of Love' (No. 5) was a poet called Bhanudatta.\n",
      "It appears from the last verse of the manuscript that he was a resident\n",
      "of the province of Tirhoot, the son of a Brahman named Ganeshwar, who\n",
      "was also a poet. The work, written in Sanscrit, gives the descriptions\n",
      "of different classes of men and women, their classes being made out from\n",
      "their age, description, conduct, etc. It contains three chapters, and\n",
      "its date is not known, and cannot be ascertained.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Stage of Love' (No. 6) was composed by the poet Kullianmull, for\n",
      "the amusement of Ladkhan, the son of Ahmed Lodi, the same Ladkhan being\n",
      "in some places spoken of as Ladana Mull, and in others as Ladanaballa.\n",
      "He is supposed to have been a relation or connection of the house of\n",
      "Lodi, which reigned in Hindostan from A.D. 1450-1526. The work would,\n",
      "therefore, have been written in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. It\n",
      "contains ten chapters, and has been translated into English, but only\n",
      "six copies were printed for private circulation. This is supposed to be\n",
      "the latest of the Sanscrit works on the subject, and the ideas in it\n",
      "were evidently taken from previous writings of the same nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contents of these works are in themselves a literary curiosity.\n",
      "There are to be found both in Sanscrit poetry and in the Sanscrit drama\n",
      "a certain amount of poetical sentiment and romance, which have, in every\n",
      "country and in every language, thrown an immortal halo round the\n",
      "subject. But here it is treated in a plain, simple, matter of fact sort\n",
      "of way. Men and women are divided into classes and divisions in the same\n",
      "way that Buffon and other writers on natural history have classified and\n",
      "divided the animal world. As Venus was represented by the Greeks to\n",
      "stand forth as the type of the beauty of woman, so the Hindoos describe\n",
      "the Padmini or Lotus woman as the type of most perfect feminine\n",
      "excellence, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "She in whom the following signs and symptoms appear is called a Padmini.\n",
      "Her face is pleasing as the full moon; her body, well clothed with\n",
      "flesh, is soft as the Shiras or mustard flower, her skin is fine,\n",
      "tender and fair as the yellow lotus, never dark coloured. Her eyes are\n",
      "bright and beautiful as the orbs of the fawn, well cut, and with reddish\n",
      "corners. Her bosom is hard, full and high; she has a good neck; her nose\n",
      "is straight and lovely, and three folds or wrinkles cross her\n",
      "middle--about the umbilical region. Her yoni resembles the opening lotus\n",
      "bud, and her love seed (Kama salila) is perfumed like the lily that has\n",
      "newly burst. She walks with swan-like gait, and her voice is low and\n",
      "musical as the note of the Kokila bird, she delights in white raiments,\n",
      "in fine jewels, and in rich dresses. She eats little, sleeps lightly,\n",
      "and being as respectful and religious as she is clever and courteous,\n",
      "she is ever anxious to worship the gods, and to enjoy the conversation\n",
      "of Brahmans. Such, then, is the Padmini or Lotus woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed descriptions then follow of the Chitrini or Art woman; the\n",
      "Shankhini or Conch woman, and the Hastini or Elephant woman, their days\n",
      "of enjoyment, their various seats of passion, the manner in which they\n",
      "should be manipulated and treated in sexual intercourse, along with the\n",
      "characteristics of the men and women of the various countries in\n",
      "Hindostan. The details are so numerous, and the subjects so seriously\n",
      "dealt with, and at such length, that neither time nor space will permit\n",
      "of their being given here.\n",
      "\n",
      "One work in the English language is somewhat similar to these works of\n",
      "the Hindoos. It is called 'Kalogynomia: or the Laws of Female Beauty,'\n",
      "being the elementary principles of that science, by T. Bell, M.D., with\n",
      "twenty-four plates, and printed in London in 1821. It treats of Beauty,\n",
      "of Love, of Sexual Intercourse, of the Laws regulating that Intercourse,\n",
      "of Monogamy and Polygamy, of Prostitution, of Infidelity, ending with a\n",
      "_catalogue raisonnée_ of the defects of female beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other works in English also enter into great details of private and\n",
      "domestic life. 'The Elements of Social Science, or Physical, Sexual and\n",
      "Natural Religion,' by a Doctor of Medicine, London, 1880, and 'Every\n",
      "Woman's Book,' by Dr. Waters, 1826. To persons interested in the above\n",
      "subjects these works will be found to contain such details as have been\n",
      "seldom before published, and which ought to be thoroughly understood by\n",
      "all philanthropists and benefactors of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a perusal of the Hindoo work, and of the English books above\n",
      "mentioned, the reader will understand the subject, at all events from a\n",
      "materialistic, realistic and practical point of view. If all science is\n",
      "founded more or less on a stratum of facts, there can be no harm in\n",
      "making known to mankind generally certain matters intimately connected\n",
      "with their private, domestic, and social life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! complete ignorance of them has unfortunately wrecked many a man\n",
      "and many a woman, while a little knowledge of a subject generally\n",
      "ignored by the masses would have enabled numbers of people to have\n",
      "understood many things which they believed to be quite incomprehensible,\n",
      "or which were not thought worthy of their consideration.\n",

      "\n",
      "It may be interesting to some persons to learn how it came about that\n",
      "Vatsyayana was first brought to light and translated into the English\n",
      "language. It happened thus. While translating with the pundits the\n",
      "'Anunga runga, or the stage of love,' reference was frequently found to\n",
      "be made to one Vatsya. The sage Vatsya was of this opinion, or of that\n",
      "opinion. The sage Vatsya said this, and so on. Naturally questions were\n",
      "asked who the sage was, and the pundits replied that Vatsya was the\n",
      "author of the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, that no\n",
      "Sanscrit library was complete without his work, and that it was most\n",
      "difficult now to obtain in its entire state. The copy of the manuscript\n",
      "obtained in Bombay was defective, and so the pundits wrote to Benares,\n",
      "Calcutta and Jeypoor for copies of the manuscript from Sanscrit\n",
      "libraries in those places. Copies having been obtained, they were then\n",
      "compared with each other, and with the aid of a Commentary called\n",
      "'Jayamangla' a revised copy of the entire manuscript was prepared, and\n",
      "from this copy the English translation was made. The following is the\n",
      "certificate of the chief pundit:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The accompanying manuscript is corrected by me after comparing four\n",
      "different copies of the work. I had the assistance of a Commentary\n",
      "called 'Jayamangla' for correcting the portion in the first five parts,\n",
      "but found great difficulty in correcting the remaining portion, because,\n",
      "with the exception of one copy thereof which was tolerably correct, all\n",
      "the other copies I had were far too incorrect. However, I took that\n",
      "portion as correct in which the majority of the copies agreed with each\n",
      "other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'Aphorisms on Love,' by Vatsyayana, contains about one thousand two\n",
      "hundred and fifty slokas or verses, and are divided into parts, parts\n",
      "into chapters, and chapters into paragraphs. The whole consists of\n",
      "seven parts, thirty-six chapters, and sixty-four paragraphs. Hardly\n",
      "anything is known about the author. His real name is supposed to be\n",
      "Mallinaga or Mrillana, Vatsyayana being his family name. At the close of\n",
      "the work this is what he writes about himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After reading and considering the works of Babhravya and other ancient\n",
      "authors, and thinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, this\n",
      "treatise was composed, according to the precepts of the Holy Writ, for\n",
      "the benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a\n",
      "religious student at Benares, and wholly engaged in the contemplation of\n",
      "the Deity. This work is not to be used merely as an instrument for\n",
      "satisfying our desires. A person acquainted with the true principles of\n",
      "this science, who preserves his Dharma (virtue or religious merit), his\n",
      "Artha (worldly wealth) and his Kama (pleasure or sensual gratification),\n",
      "and who has regard to the customs of the people, is sure to obtain the\n",
      "mastery over his senses. In short, an intelligent and knowing person,\n",
      "attending to Dharma and Artha and also to Kama, without becoming the\n",
      "slave of his passions, will obtain success in everything that he may\n",
      "do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible to fix the exact date either of the life of Vatsyayana\n",
      "or of his work. It is supposed that he must have lived between the first\n",
      "and the sixth centuries of the Christian era, on the following\n",
      "grounds:--He mentions that Satkarni Srtvahan, a king of Kuntal, killed\n",
      "Malayevati his wife with an instrument called kartari by striking her in\n",
      "the passion of love, and Vatsya quotes this case to warn people of the\n",
      "danger arising from some old customs of striking women when under the\n",
      "influence of this passion. Now this king of Kuntal is believed to have\n",
      "lived and reigned during the first century A.C., and consequently Vatsya\n",
      "must have lived after him. On the other hand, Virahamihira, in the\n",
      "eighteenth chapter of his 'Brihatsanhita,' treats of the science of\n",
      "love, and appears to have borrowed largely from Vatsyayana on the\n",
      "subject. Now Virahamihira is said to have lived during the sixth century\n",
      "A.D., and as Vatsya must have written his works previously, therefore\n",
      "not earlier than the first century, A.C., and not later than the sixth\n",
      "century A.D., must be considered as the approximate date of his\n",
      "existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the text of the 'Aphorisms on Love,' by Vatsyayana, only two\n",
      "commentaries have been found. One called 'Jayamangla' or 'Sutrabashya,'\n",
      "and the other 'Sutra vritti.' The date of the 'Jayamangla' is fixed\n",
      "between the tenth and thirteenth centuries A.D., because while treating\n",
      "of the sixty-four arts an example is taken from the 'Kávyaprakásha,'\n",
      "which was written about the tenth century A.D. Again, the copy of the\n",
      "commentary procured was evidently a transcript of a manuscript which\n",
      "once had a place in the library of a Chaulukyan king named Vishaladeva,\n",
      "a fact elicited from the following sentence at the end of it:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here ends the part relating to the art of love in the commentary on the\n",
      "'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' a copy from the library of the king of kings,\n",
      "Vishaladeva, who was a powerful hero, as it were a second Arjuna, and\n",
      "head jewel of the Chaulukya family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it is well known that this king ruled in Guzerat from 1244 to 1262\n",
      "A.D., and founded a city called Visalnagur. The date, therefore, of the\n",
      "commentary is taken to be not earlier than the tenth and not later than\n",
      "the thirteenth century. The author of it is supposed to be one\n",
      "Yashodhara, the name given him by his preceptor being Indrapada. He\n",
      "seems to have written it during the time of affliction caused by his\n",
      "separation from a clever and shrewd woman, at least that is what he\n",
      "himself says at the end of each chapter. It is presumed that he called\n",
      "his work after the name of his absent mistress, or the word may have\n",
      "some connection with the meaning of her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "This commentary was most useful in explaining the true meaning of\n",
      "Vatsyayana, for the commentator appears to have had a considerable\n",
      "knowledge of the times of the older author, and gives in some places\n",
      "very minute information. This cannot be said of the other commentary,\n",
      "called \"Sutra vritti,\" which was written about A.D., by Narsing Shastri,\n",
      "a pupil of a Sarveshwar Shastri; the latter was a descendant of Bhaskur,\n",
      "and so also was our author, for at the conclusion of every part he calls\n",
      "himself Bhaskur Narsing Shastra. He was induced to write the work by\n",
      "order of the learned Raja Vrijalala, while he was residing in Benares,\n",
      "but as to the merits of this commentary it does not deserve much\n",
      "commendation. In many cases the writer does not appear to have\n",
      "understood the meaning of the original author, and has changed the text\n",
      "in many places to fit in with his own explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "A complete translation of the original work now follows. It has been\n",
      "prepared in complete accordance with the text of the manuscript, and is\n",

      "\n",
      "It is not right to say so. As the acquisition of every object\n",
      "pre-supposes at all events some exertion on the part of man, the\n",
      "application of proper means may be said to be the cause of gaining all\n",
      "our ends, and this application of proper means being thus necessary\n",

      "superior to them, and are also disliked by meritorious persons.\n",
      "Pleasures also bring a man into distress, and into contact with low\n",
      "persons; they cause him to commit unrighteous deeds, and produce\n",

      "carelessness and levity. And lastly, they cause him to be disbelieved by\n",
      "all, received by none, and despised by everybody, including himself. It\n",
      "is notorious, moreover, that many men who have given themselves up to\n",
      "pleasure alone, have been ruined along with their families and\n",
      "relations. Thus, King Dandakya,[7] of the Bhoja dynasty, carried off a\n",
      "Brahman's daughter with evil intent, and was eventually ruined and lost\n",
      "his kingdom. Indra, too, having violated the chastity of Ahalya,[8] was\n",
      "made to suffer for it. In a like manner the mighty Kichaka,[9] who tried\n",
      "to seduce Draupadi, and Ravana,[10] who attempted to gain over Sita, were\n",
      "punished for their crimes. These and many others fell by reason of their\n",
      "pleasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "_Answer._\n",
      "\n",
      "This objection cannot be sustained, for pleasures, being as necessary\n",

      "equally required. They are, moreover, the results of Dharma and Artha.\n",
      "Pleasures are, therefore, to be followed with moderation and caution. No\n",

      "is grown up.\n",

      "which there is no fear as to what is to result from them in the next\n",
      "world, and in which there is no danger to their welfare. Any action\n",
      "which conduces to the practice of Dharma, Artha and Kama together, or of\n",
      "any two, or even one of them, should be performed, but an action which\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Man should study the Kama Sutra and the arts and sciences subordinate\n",
      "thereto, in addition to the study of the arts and sciences contained in\n",
      "Dharma and Artha. Even young maids should study this Kama Sutra along\n",

      "Here some learned men object, and say that females, not being allowed to\n",

      "\n",
      "But Vatsyayana is of opinion that this objection does not hold good, for\n",
      "women already know the practice of Kama Sutra, and that practice is\n",
      "derived from the Kama Shastra, or the science of Kama itself. Moreover,\n",
      "it is not only in this but in many other cases that though the practice\n",
      "of a science is known to all, only a few persons are acquainted with the\n",
      "rules and laws on which the science is based. Thus the Yadnikas or\n",
      "sacrificers, though ignorant of grammar, make use of appropriate words\n",
      "when addressing the different Deities, and do not know how these words\n",
      "are framed. Again, persons do the duties required of them on auspicious\n",
      "days, which are fixed by astrology, though they are not acquainted with\n",
      "the science of astrology. In a like manner riders of horses and\n",
      "elephants train these animals without knowing the science of training\n",
      "animals, but from practice only. And similarly the people of the most\n",
      "distant provinces obey the laws of the kingdom from practice, and\n",
      "because there is a king over them, and without further reason.[11] And\n",

      "but it is impossible for them to tell you what kind of pleasure they\n",
      "feel. The fact from which this becomes evident is, that males, when\n",
      "engaged in coition, cease of themselves after emission, and are\n",
      "satisfied, but it is not so with females.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This opinion is, however, objected to on the grounds that if a male be a\n",
      "long-timed, the female loves him the more, but if he be short-timed, she\n",
      "is dissatisfied with him. And this circumstance, some say, would prove\n",
      "that the female emits also.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this opinion does not hold good, for if it takes a long time to\n",
      "allay a woman's desire, and during this time she is enjoying great\n",
      "pleasure, it is quite natural then that she should wish for its\n",
      "continuation. And on this subject there is a verse as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By union with men the lust, desire, or passion of women is satisfied,\n",

      "continues to fall from the beginning of the sexual union to its end, and\n",
      "it is right that it should be so, for if they had no semen there would\n",
      "be no embryo.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this there is an objection. In the beginning of coition the passion\n",
      "of the woman is middling, and she cannot bear the vigorous thrusts of\n",
      "her lover, but by degrees her passion increases until she ceases to\n",
      "think about her body, and then finally she wishes to stop from further\n",
      "coition.\n",
      "\n",
      "This objection, however, does not hold good, for even in ordinary things\n",
      "that revolve with great force, such as a potter's wheel, or a top, we\n",
      "find that the motion at first is slow, but by degrees it becomes very\n",
      "rapid. In the same way the passion of the woman having gradually\n",
      "increased, she has a desire to discontinue coition, when all the semen\n",
      "has fallen away. And there is a verse with regard to this as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The fall of the semen of the man takes place only at the end of\n",
      "coition, while the semen of the woman falls continually, and after the\n",
      "semen of both has all fallen away then they wish for the discontinuance\n",
      "of coition.\"[34]\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Vatsyayana is of opinion that the semen of the female falls in\n",
      "the same way as that of the male.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now some may ask here: If men and women are beings of the same kind, and\n",
      "are engaged in bringing about the same result, why should they have\n",
      "different works to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vatsya says that this is so, because the ways of working as well as the\n",
      "consciousness of pleasure in men and women are different. The difference\n",
      "in the ways of working, by which men are the actors, and women are the\n",
      "persons acted upon, is owing to the nature of the male and the female,\n",
      "otherwise the actor would be sometimes the person acted upon, and vice\n",
      "versâ. And from this difference in the ways of working follows the\n",
      "difference in the consciousness of pleasure, for a man thinks, \"this\n",
      "woman is united with me,\" and a woman thinks, \"I am united with this\n",
      "man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be said that if the ways of working in men and women are\n",
      "different, why should not there be a difference, even in the pleasure\n",
      "they feel, and which is the result of those ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this objection is groundless, for the person acting and the person\n",
      "acted upon being of different kinds, there is a reason for the\n",
      "difference in their ways of working; but there is no reason for any\n",
      "difference in the pleasure they feel, because they both naturally derive\n",
      "pleasure from the act they perform.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "On this again some may say that when different persons are engaged in\n",
      "doing the same work, we find that they accomplish the same end or\n",
      "purpose: while, on the contrary, in the case of men and women we find\n",
      "that each of them accomplishes his or her own end separately, and this\n",
      "is inconsistent. But this is a mistake, for we find that sometimes two\n",
      "things are done at the same time, as for instance in the fighting of\n",
      "rams, both the rams receive the shock at the same time on their heads.\n",
      "Again, in throwing one wood apple against another, and also in a fight\n",
      "or struggle of wrestlers. If it be said that in these cases the things\n",
      "employed are of the same kind, it is answered that even in the case of\n",
      "men and women, the nature of the two persons is the same. And as the\n",
      "difference in their ways of working arises from the difference of their\n",
      "conformation only, it follows that men experience the same kind of\n",
      "pleasure as women do.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a verse on this subject as follows: \"Men and women being\n",

      "\n",
      "The pleasure of men and women being thus proved to be of the same kind,\n",
      "it follows that in regard to time, there are nine kinds of sexual\n",

      "think suitable for the occasion.[36]\n",
      "\n",
      "At the first time of sexual union the passion of the male is intense,\n",
      "and his time is short, but in subsequent unions on the same day the\n",
      "reverse of this is the case. With the female, however, it is the\n",
      "contrary, for at the first time her passion is weak, and then her time\n",

      "This part of the Kama Shastra, which treats of sexual union, is also\n",
      "called \"Sixty-four\" (Chatushshashti). Some old authors say that it is\n",
      "called so, because it contains sixty-four chapters. Others are of\n",
      "opinion that the author of this part being a person named Panchala, and\n",
      "the person who recited the part of the Rig Veda called Dashatapa, which\n",
      "contains sixty-four verses, being also called Panchala, the name\n",
      "\"sixty-four\" has been given to the part of the work in honour of the Rig\n",
      "Vedas. The followers of Babhravya say on the other hand that this part\n",
      "contains eight subjects, viz., the embrace, kissing, scratching with the\n",
      "nails or fingers, biting, lying down, making various sounds, playing the\n",
      "part of a man, and the Auparishtaka, or mouth congress. Each of these\n",
      "subjects being of eight kinds, and eight multiplied by eight being\n",
      "sixty-four, this part is therefore named \"sixty-four.\" But Vatsyayana\n",
      "affirms that as this part contains also the following subjects, viz.,\n",
      "striking, crying, the acts of a man during congress, the various kinds\n",
      "of congress, and other subjects, the name \"sixty-four\" is given to it\n",
      "only accidentally. As, for instance, we say this tree is \"Saptaparna,\"\n",
      "or seven-leaved, this offering of rice is \"Panchavarna,\" or\n",
      "five-coloured, but the tree has not seven leaves, neither has the rice\n",
      "five colours.\n",
      "\n",
      "However the part sixty-four is now treated of, and the embrace, being\n",
      "the first subject, will now be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the embrace which indicates the mutual love of a man and woman who\n",
      "have come together is of four kinds, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "   Touching.\n",
      "   Piercing.\n",
      "   Rubbing.\n",
      "   Pressing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The action in each case is denoted by the meaning of the word which\n",
      "stands for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When a man under some pretext or other goes in front or alongside\n",
      "of a woman and touches her body with his own, it is called the \"touching\n",
      "embrace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When a woman in a lonely place bends down, as if to pick up\n",
      "something, and pierces, as it were, a man sitting or standing, with her\n",
      "breasts, and the man in return takes hold of them, it is called a\n",
      "\"piercing embrace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The above two kinds of embrace takes place only between persons who do\n",
      "not, as yet, speak freely with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When two lovers are walking slowly together, either in the dark, or\n",
      "in a place of public resort, or in a lonely place, and rub their bodies\n",
      "against each other, it is called a \"rubbing embrace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). When on the above occasion one of them presses the other's body\n",
      "forcibly against a wall or pillar, it is called a \"pressing embrace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These two last embraces are peculiar to those who know the intentions of\n",
      "each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of the meeting the four following kinds of embrace are used,\n",
      "viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "_Jataveshtitaka_, or the twining of a creeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Vrikshadhirudhaka_, or climbing a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Tila-Tandulaka_, or the mixture of sesamum seed with rice.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Kshiraniraka_, or milk and water embrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When a woman, clinging to a man as a creeper twines round a tree,\n",
      "bends his head down to hers with the desire of kissing him and slightly\n",
      "makes the sound of sut sut, embraces him, and looks lovingly towards\n",
      "him, it is called an embrace like the \"twining of a creeper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When a woman, having placed one of her feet on the foot of her\n",
      "lover, and the other on one of his thighs, passes one of her arms round\n",
      "his back, and the other on his shoulders, makes slightly the sounds of\n",
      "singing and cooing, and wishes, as it were, to climb up him in order to\n",
      "have a kiss, it is called an embrace like the \"climbing of a tree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These two kinds of embrace take place when the lover is standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When lovers lie on a bed, and embrace each other so closely that\n",
      "the arms and thighs of the one are encircled by the arms and thighs of\n",
      "the other, and are, as it were, rubbing up against them, this is called\n",
      "an embrace like \"the mixture of sesamum seed with rice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). When a man and a woman are very much in love with each other, and\n",
      "not thinking of any pain or hurt, embrace each other as if they were\n",
      "entering into each other's bodies, either while the woman is sitting on\n",
      "the lap of the man or in front of him, or on a bed, then it is called an\n",
      "embrace like a \"mixture of milk and water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These two kinds of embrace take place at the time of sexual union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Babhravya has thus related to us the above eight kinds of embraces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suvarnanabha, moreover, gives us four ways of embracing simple members\n",
      "of the body, which are:\n",
      "\n",
      "The embrace of the thighs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The embrace of the jaghana, _i.e._, the part of the body from the navel\n",
      "downwards to the thighs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The embrace of the breasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The embrace of the forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When one of two lovers presses forcibly one or both of the thighs\n",
      "of the other between his or her own, it is called the \"embrace of\n",
      "thighs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When a man presses the jaghana or middle part of the woman's body\n",
      "against his own, and mounts upon her to practise, either scratching with\n",
      "the nail or finger, or biting, or striking, or kissing, the hair of the\n",
      "woman being loose and flowing, it is called the \"embrace of the\n",
      "jaghana.\"\n",

      "It is said by some that there is no fixed time or order between the\n",
      "embrace, the kiss, and the pressing or scratching with the nails or\n",
      "fingers, but that all these things should be done generally before\n",
      "sexual union takes place, while striking and making the various sounds\n",
      "generally takes place at the time of the union. Vatsyayana, however,\n",
      "thinks that anything may take place at any time, for love does not care\n",
      "for time or order.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the occasion of the first congress, kissing and the other things\n",
      "mentioned above should be done moderately, they should not be continued\n",
      "for a long time, and should be done alternately. On subsequent\n",
      "occasions, however, the reverse of all this may take place, and\n",
      "moderation will not be necessary, they may continue for a long time, and\n",
      "for the purpose of kindling love, they may be all done at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are the places for kissing, viz., the forehead, the eyes,\n",
      "the cheeks, the throat, the bosom, the breasts, the lips, and the\n",
      "interior of the mouth. Moreover, the people of the Lat country kiss also\n",
      "on the following places, viz., the joints of the thighs, the arms, and\n",
      "the navel. But Vatsyayana thinks that though kissing is practised by\n",
      "these people in the above places on account of the intensity of their\n",
      "love, and the customs of their country, it is not fit to be practised by\n",
      "all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in a case of a young girl there are three sort of kisses, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "   The nominal kiss.\n",
      "   The throbbing kiss.\n",
      "   The touching kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When a girl only touches the mouth of her lover with her own, but\n",
      "does not herself do anything, it is called the \"nominal kiss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When a girl, setting aside her bashfulness a little, wishes to\n",
      "touch the lip that is pressed into her mouth, and with that object\n",
      "moves her lower lip, but not the upper one, it is called the \"throbbing\n",
      "kiss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When a girl touches her lover's lip with her tongue, and having\n",
      "shut her eyes, places her hands on those of her lover, it is called the\n",
      "\"touching kiss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Other authors describe four other kinds of kisses, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "   The straight kiss.\n",
      "   The bent kiss.\n",
      "   The turned kiss.\n",
      "   The pressed kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When the lips of two lovers are brought into direct contact with\n",
      "each other, it is called a \"straight kiss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When the heads of two lovers are bent towards each other, and when\n",
      "so bent kissing takes place, it is called a \"bent kiss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When one of them turns up the face of the other by holding the head\n",
      "and chin, and then kissing, it is called a \"turned kiss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). Lastly, when the lower lip is pressed with much force, it is called\n",
      "a \"pressed kiss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a fifth kind of kiss called the \"greatly pressed kiss,\"\n",
      "which is effected by taking hold of the lower lip between two fingers,\n",
      "and then after touching it with the tongue, pressing it with great force\n",
      "with the lip.\n",
      "\n",
      "As regards kissing, a wager may be laid as to which will get hold of the\n",
      "lips of the other first. If the woman loses, she should pretend to cry,\n",
      "should keep her lover off by shaking her hands, and turn away from him\n",
      "and dispute with him, saying \"let another wager be laid.\" If she loses\n",
      "this a second time, she should appear doubly distressed, and when her\n",
      "lover is off his guard or asleep, she should get hold of his lower lip,\n",
      "and hold it in her teeth, so that it should not slip away, and then she\n",
      "should laugh, make a loud noise, deride him, dance about, and say\n",
      "whatever she likes in a joking way, moving her eyebrows, and rolling her\n",
      "eyes. Such are the wagers and quarrels as far as kissing is concerned,\n",
      "but the same may be applied with regard to the pressing or scratching\n",
      "with the nails and fingers, biting and striking. All these, however, are\n",
      "only peculiar to men and women of intense passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man kisses the upper lip of a woman, while she in return kisses\n",
      "his lower lip, it is called the \"kiss of the upper lip.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When one of them takes both the lips of the other between his or her\n",
      "own, it is called \"a clasping kiss.\" A woman, however, only takes this\n",
      "kind of kiss from a man who has no moustache. And on the occasion of\n",
      "this kiss, if one of them touches the teeth, the tongue, and the palate\n",
      "of the other, with his or her tongue, it is called the \"fighting of the\n",
      "tongue.\" In the same way, the pressing of the teeth of the one against\n",
      "the mouth of the other is to be practised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kissing is of four kinds, viz., moderate, contracted, pressed, and soft,\n",

      "When a woman looks at the face of her lover while he is asleep, and\n",

      "time of her lover's arrival, so that she may know his intention and\n",
      "obtain respect from him.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Pressing with the nails is of the eight following kinds, according to\n",

      "The qualities of good nails are that they should be bright, well set,\n",

      "jaghana of another so softly that no scratch or mark is left, but only\n",
      "the hair on the body becomes erect from the touch of the nails, and the\n",
      "nails themselves make a sound, it is called a \"sounding or pressing with\n",
      "the nails.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This pressing is used in the case of a young girl when her lover\n",
      "shampoos her, scratches her head, and wants to trouble or frighten her.\n",

      "(2). The curved mark with the nails, which is impressed on the neck and\n",
      "the breasts, is called the \"half moon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When the half moons are impressed opposite to each other, it is\n",
      "called a \"circle.\" This mark with the nails is generally made on the\n",
      "navel, the small cavities about the buttocks, and on the joints of the\n",
      "thigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). A mark in the form of a small line, and which can be made on any\n",
      "part of the body, is called a \"line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). This same line, when it is curved, and made on the breast, is\n",

      "nails, it is called a \"peacock's foot.\" This mark is made with the\n",
      "object of being praised, for it requires a great deal of skill to make\n",
      "it properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "(7). When five marks with the nails are made close to one another near\n",
      "the nipple of the breast, it is called \"the jump of a hare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(8). A mark made on the breast or on the hips in the form of a leaf of\n",
      "the blue lotus, is called the \"leaf of a blue lotus.\"\n",

      "When a person is going on a journey, and makes a mark on the thighs, or\n",
      "on the breast, it is called a \"token of remembrance.\" On such an\n",
      "occasion three or four lines are impressed close to one another with the\n",
      "nails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here ends the marking with the nails. Marks of other kinds than the\n",

      "that as there are innumerable degrees of skill among men (the practice\n",
      "of this art being known to all), so there are innumerable ways of making\n",
      "these marks. And as pressing or marking with the nails is independent of\n",
      "love, no one can say with certainty how many different kinds of marks\n",
      "with the nails do actually exist. The reason of this is, Vatsyayana\n",
      "says, that as variety is necessary in love, so love is to be produced by\n",
      "means of variety. It is on this account that courtezans, who are well\n",
      "acquainted with various ways and means, become so desirable, for if\n",
      "variety is sought in all the arts and amusements, such as archery and\n",
      "others, how much more should it be sought after in the present case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marks of the nails should not be made on married women, but\n",
      "particular kinds of marks may be made on their private parts for the\n",

      "\"The love of a woman who sees the marks of nails on the private parts of\n",
      "her body, even though they are old and almost worn out, becomes again\n",
      "fresh and new. If there be no marks of nails to remind a person of the\n",
      "passages of love, then love is lessened in the same way as when no union\n",
      "takes place for a long time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when a stranger sees at a distance a young woman with the marks of\n",
      "nails on her breast,[37] he is filled with love and respect for her.\n",

      "A man, also, who carries the marks of nails and teeth on some parts of\n",

      "\n",
      "OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LYING DOWN, AND VARIOUS KINDS OF CONGRESS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the occasion of a \"high congress\" the Mrigi (Deer) woman should lie\n",
      "down in such a way as to widen her yoni, while in a \"low congress\" the\n",
      "Hastini (Elephant) woman should lie down so as to contract hers. But in\n",
      "an \"equal congress\" they should lie down in the natural position. What\n",
      "is said above concerning the Mrigi and the Hastini applies also to the\n",
      "Vadawa (Mare) woman. In a \"low congress\" the women should particularly\n",
      "make use of medicine, to cause her desires to be satisfied quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Deer-woman has the following three ways of lying down.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The widely opened position.\n",
      "   The yawning position.\n",
      "   The position of the wife of Indra.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When she lowers her head and raises her middle parts, it is called\n",
      "the \"widely opened position.\" At such a time the man should apply some\n",
      "unguent, so as to make the entrance easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When she raises her thighs and keeps them wide apart and engages in\n",
      "congress, it is called the \"yawning position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When she places her thighs with her legs doubled on them upon her\n",
      "sides, and thus engages in congress, it is called the position of\n",
      "Indrani, and this is learnt only by practice. The position is also\n",
      "useful in the case of the \"highest congress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"clasping position\" is used in \"low congress,\" and in the \"lowest\n",
      "congress,\" together with the \"pressing position,\" the \"twining\n",
      "position\", and the \"mare's position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the legs of both the male and the female are stretched straight\n",
      "out over each other, it is called the \"clasping position.\" It is of two\n",
      "kinds, the side position and the supine position, according to the way\n",
      "in which they lie down. In the side position the male should invariably\n",
      "lie on his left side, and cause the woman to lie on her right side, and\n",
      "this rule is to be observed in lying down with all kinds of women.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, after congress has begun in the clasping position, the woman\n",
      "presses her lover with her thighs, it is called the \"pressing position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the woman places one of her thighs across the thigh of her lover,\n",
      "it is called the \"twining position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When a woman forcibly holds in her yoni the lingam after it is in, it is\n",
      "called the \"mare's position.\" This is learnt by practice only, and is\n",
      "chiefly found among the women of the Andra country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above are the different ways of lying down, mentioned by Babhravya;\n",
      "Suvarnanabha, however, gives the following in addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the female raises both of her thighs straight up, it is called the\n",
      "\"rising position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When she raises both of her legs, and places them on her lover's\n",
      "shoulders, it is called the \"yawning position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the legs are contracted, and thus held by the lover before his\n",
      "bosom, it is called the \"pressed position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When only one of her legs is stretched out, it is called the \"half\n",
      "pressed position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the woman places one of her legs on her lover's shoulder, and\n",
      "stretches the other out, and then places the latter on his shoulder, and\n",
      "stretches out the other, and continues to do so alternately, it is\n",
      "called the \"splitting of a bamboo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When one of her legs is placed on the head, and the other is stretched\n",
      "out, it is called the \"fixing of a nail.\" This is learnt by practice\n",
      "only.\n",
      "\n",
      "When both the legs of the woman are contracted, and placed on her\n",
      "stomach, it is called the \"crab's position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the thighs are raised and placed one upon the other, it is called\n",
      "the \"packed position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the shanks are placed one upon the other, it is called the\n",
      "\"lotus-like position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man, during congress, turns round, and enjoys the woman without\n",
      "leaving her, while she embraces him round the back all the time, it is\n",
      "called the \"turning position,\" and is learnt only by practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus says Suvarnanabha, these different ways of lying down, sitting, and\n",
      "standing should be practised in water, because it is easy to do so\n",
      "therein. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that congress in water is\n",
      "improper, because it is prohibited by the religious law.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man and a woman support themselves on each other's bodies, or on\n",
      "a wall, or pillar, and thus while standing engage in congress, it is\n",
      "called the \"supported congress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man supports himself against a wall, and the woman, sitting on\n",
      "his hands joined together and held underneath her, throws her arms round\n",
      "his neck, and putting her thighs alongside his waist, moves herself by\n",
      "her feet, which are touching the wall against which the man is leaning,\n",
      "it is called the \"suspended congress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When a woman stands on her hands and feet like a quadruped, and her\n",
      "lover mounts her like a bull, it is called the \"congress of a cow.\" At\n",
      "this time everything that is ordinarily done on the bosom should be done\n",
      "on the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same way can be carried on the congress of a dog, the congress of\n",
      "a goat, the congress of a deer, the forcible mounting of an ass, the\n",
      "congress of a cat, the jump of a tiger, the pressing of an elephant, the\n",
      "rubbing of a boar, and the mounting of a horse. And in all these cases\n",
      "the characteristics of these different animals should be manifested by\n",
      "acting like them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man enjoys two women at the same time, both of whom love him\n",
      "equally, it is called the \"united congress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man enjoys many women altogether, it is called the \"congress of a\n",
      "herd of cows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The following kinds of congress, viz., sporting in water, or the\n",
      "congress of an elephant with many female elephants, which is said to\n",
      "take place only in the water, the congress of a collection of goats, the\n",
      "congress of a collection of deer, take place in imitation of these\n",
      "animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Gramaneri many young men enjoy a woman that may be married to one of\n",
      "them, either one after the other, or at the same time. Thus one of them\n",
      "holds her, another enjoys her, a third uses her mouth, a fourth holds\n",
      "her middle part, and in this way they go on enjoying her several parts\n",
      "alternately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same things can be done when several men are sitting in company with\n",
      "one courtesan, or when one courtesan is alone with many men. In the same\n",
      "way this can be done by the women of the King's harem when they\n",
      "accidentally get hold of a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people in the Southern countries have also a congress in the anus,\n",

      "OF THE VARIOUS MODES OF STRIKING, AND OF THE SOUNDS APPROPRIATE TO THEM.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexual intercourse can be compared to a quarrel, on account of the\n",
      "contrarieties of love and its tendency to dispute. The place of striking\n",
      "with passion is the body, and on the body the special places are:\n",
      "\n",
      "   The shoulders.\n",
      "   The head.\n",
      "   The space between the breasts.\n",
      "   The back.\n",
      "   The jaghana, or middle part of the body.\n",
      "   The sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Striking is of four kinds, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "   Striking with the back of the hand.\n",
      "   Striking with the fingers a little contracted.\n",
      "   Striking with the fist.\n",
      "   Striking with the open palm of the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "On account of its causing pain, striking gives rise to the hissing\n",
      "sound, which is of various kinds, and to the eight kinds of crying,\n",
      "viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "   The sound Hin.\n",
      "   The thundering sound.\n",
      "   The cooing sound.\n",
      "   The weeping sound.\n",
      "   The sound Phut.\n",
      "   The sound Phât.\n",
      "   The sound Sût.\n",
      "   The sound Plât.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides these, there are also words having a meaning, such as \"mother,\"\n",
      "and those that are expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, desire of\n",
      "liberation, pain or praise, and to which may be added sounds like those\n",
      "of the dove, the cuckoo, the green pigeon, the parrot, the bee, the\n",
      "sparrow, the flamingo, the duck, and the quail, which are all\n",
      "occasionally made use of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blows with the fist should be given on the back of the woman, while she\n",
      "is sitting on the lap of the man, and she should give blows in return,\n",
      "abusing the man as if she were angry, and making the cooing and the\n",
      "weeping sounds. While the woman is engaged in congress the space between\n",
      "the breasts should be struck with the back of the hand, slowly at first,\n",
      "and then proportionately to the increasing excitement, until the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time the sounds Hin and others may be made, alternately or\n",
      "optionally, according to habit. When the man, making the sound Phât,\n",
      "strikes the woman on the head, with the fingers of his hand a little\n",
      "contracted, it is called Prasritaka, which means striking with the\n",
      "fingers of the hand a little contracted. In this case the appropriate\n",
      "sounds are the cooing sound, the sound Phât, and the sound Phut in the\n",
      "interior of the mouth, and at the end of congress the sighing and\n",
      "weeping sounds. The sound Phât is an imitation of the sound of a bamboo\n",
      "being split, while the sound Phut is like the sound made by something\n",
      "falling into water. At all times when kissing and such like things are\n",
      "begun, the woman should give a reply with a hissing sound. During the\n",
      "excitement when the woman is not accustomed to striking, she continually\n",
      "utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiently, or desire of\n",
      "liberation, as well as the words \"father,\" \"mother,\" intermingled with\n",
      "the sighing, weeping and thundering sounds.[38] Towards the conclusion\n",
      "of the congress, the breasts, the jaghana, and the sides of the woman\n",
      "should be pressed with the open palms of the hand, with some force,\n",
      "until the end of it, and then sounds like those of the quail, or the\n",
      "goose should be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also two verses on the subject as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The characteristics of manhood are said to consist of roughness and\n",
      "impetuosity, while weakness, tenderness, sensibility, and an inclination\n",
      "to turn away from unpleasant things are the distinguishing marks of\n",
      "womanhood. The excitement of passion, and peculiarities of habit may\n",
      "sometimes cause contrary results to appear, but these do not last long,\n",
      "and in the end the natural state is resumed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedge on the bosom, the scissors on the head, the piercing\n",
      "instrument on the cheeks, and the pinchers on the breasts and sides, may\n",
      "also be taken into consideration with the other four modes of striking,\n",
      "and thus give eight ways altogether. But these four ways of striking\n",
      "with instruments are peculiar to the people of the southern countries,\n",
      "and the marks caused by them are seen on the breasts of their women.\n",
      "They are local peculiarities, but Vatsyayana is of opinion that the\n",
      "practice of them is painful, barbarous, and base, and quite unworthy of\n",
      "imitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same way anything that is a local peculiarity should not always\n",
      "be adopted elsewhere, and even in the place where the practice is\n",
      "prevalent, excess of it should always be avoided. Instances of the\n",
      "dangerous use of them may be given as follows. The King of the Panchalas\n",
      "killed the courtezan Madhavasena by means of the wedge during congress.\n",
      "King Shatakarni Shatavahana of the Kuntalas deprived his great Queen\n",
      "Malayavati of her life by a pair of scissors, and Naradeva, whose hand\n",
      "was deformed, blinded a dancing girl by directing a piercing instrument\n",
      "in a wrong way.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also two verses on the subject as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About these things there cannot be either enumeration or any definite\n",
      "rule. Congress having once commenced, passion alone gives birth to all\n",
      "the acts of the parties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such passionate actions and amorous gesticulations or movements, which\n",
      "arise on the spur of the moment, and during sexual intercourse, cannot\n",
      "be defined, and are as irregular as dreams. A horse having once attained\n",
      "the fifth degree of motion goes on with blind speed, regardless of pits,\n",
      "ditches, and posts in his way; and in the same manner a loving pair\n",
      "become blind with passion in the heat of congress, and go on with great\n",
      "impetuosity, paying not the least regard to excess. For this reason one\n",
      "who is well acquainted with the science of love, and knowing his own\n",
      "strength, as also the tenderness, impetuosity, and strength of the young\n",
      "woman, should act accordingly. The various modes of enjoyment are not\n",

      "ABOUT WOMEN ACTING THE PART OF A MAN; AND OF THE WORK OF A MAN.\n",

      "\n",
      "When a woman sees that her lover is fatigued by constant congress,\n",
      "without having his desire satisfied, she should, with his permission,\n",
      "lay him down upon his back, and give him assistance by acting his part.\n",
      "She may also do this to satisfy the curiosity of her lover, or her own\n",
      "desire of novelty.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two ways of doing this, the first is when during congress she\n",
      "turns round, and gets on the top of her lover, in such a manner as to\n",
      "continue the congress, without obstructing the pleasure of it; and the\n",
      "other is when she acts the man's part from the beginning. At such a\n",
      "time, with flowers in her hair hanging loose, and her smiles broken by\n",
      "hard breathings, she should press upon her lover's bosom with her own\n",
      "breasts, and lowering her head frequently, should do in return the same\n",
      "actions which he used to do before, returning his blows and chaffing\n",
      "him, should say, \"I was laid down by you, and fatigued with hard\n",
      "congress, I shall now therefore lay you down in return.\" She should then\n",
      "again manifest her own bashfulness, her fatigue, and her desire of\n",
      "stopping the congress. In this way she should do the work of a man,\n",
      "which we shall presently relate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever is done by a man for giving pleasure to a woman is called the\n",
      "work of a man, and is as follows:--\n",

      "While the woman is lying on his bed, and is as it were abstracted by his\n",
      "conversation, he should loosen the knot of her under garments, and when\n",
      "she begins to dispute with him, he should overwhelm her with kisses.\n",
      "Then when his lingam is erect he should touch her with his hands in\n",
      "various places, and gently manipulate various parts of the body. If the\n",
      "woman is bashful, and if it is the first time that they have come\n",
      "together, the man should place his hands between her thighs, which she\n",
      "would probably keep close together, and if she is a very young girl, he\n",
      "should first get his hands upon her breasts, which she would probably\n",
      "cover with her own hands, and under her armpits and on her neck. If\n",
      "however she is a seasoned woman, he should do whatever is agreeable\n",
      "either to him or to her, and whatever is fitting for the occasion. After\n",
      "this he should take hold of her hair, and hold her chin in his fingers\n",
      "for the purpose of kissing her. On this, if she is a young girl, she\n",
      "will become bashful and close her eyes. Any how he should gather from\n",

      "together as possible. On the other hand, the signs of her want of\n",
      "enjoyment and of failing to be satisfied are as follows: she shakes her\n",
      "hands, she does not let the man get up, feels dejected, bites the man,\n",
      "kicks him, and continues to go on moving after the man has finished. In\n",
      "such cases the man should rub the yoni of the woman with his hand and\n",
      "fingers (as the elephant rubs anything with his trunk) before engaging\n",
      "in congress, until it is softened, and after that is done he should\n",
      "proceed to put his lingam into her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acts to be done by the man are:\n",
      "\n",
      "   Moving forward.\n",
      "   Friction or churning.\n",
      "   Piercing.\n",
      "   Rubbing.\n",
      "   Pressing.\n",
      "   Giving a blow.\n",
      "   The blow of a boar.\n",
      "   The blow of a bull.\n",
      "   The sporting of a sparrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When the organs are brought together properly and directly it is\n",
      "called \"moving the organ forward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When the lingam is held with the hand, and turned all round in the\n",
      "yoni, it is called \"churning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When the yoni is lowered, and the upper part of it is struck with\n",
      "the lingam, it is called \"piercing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). When the same thing is done on the lower part of the yoni, it is\n",
      "called \"rubbing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). When the yoni is pressed by the lingam for a long time, it is\n",
      "called \"pressing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(6). When the lingam is removed to some distance from the yoni, and then\n",
      "forcibly strikes it, it is called \"giving a blow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(7). When only one part of the yoni is rubbed with the lingam, it is\n",
      "called the \"blow of a boar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(8). When both sides of the yoni are rubbed in this way, it is called\n",
      "the \"blow of a bull.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(9). When the lingam is in the yoni, and moved up and down frequently,\n",
      "and without being taken out, it is called the \"sporting of a sparrow.\"\n",
      "This takes place at the end of congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a woman acts the part of a man, she has the following things to do\n",
      "in addition to the nine given above, viz.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The pair of tongs.\n",
      "   The top.\n",
      "   The swing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When the woman holds the lingam in her yoni, draws it in, presses\n",
      "it, and keeps it thus in her for a long time, it is called the \"pair of\n",
      "tongs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When, while engaged in congress, she turns round like a wheel, it\n",
      "is called the \"top.\" This is learnt by practice only.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When, on such an occasion, the man lifts up the middle part of his\n",
      "body, and the woman turns round her middle part, it is called the\n",
      "\"swing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the woman is tired, she should place her forehead on that of her\n",
      "lover, and should thus take rest without disturbing the union of the\n",
      "organs, and when the woman has rested herself the man should turn round\n",
      "and begin the congress again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also some verses on the subject as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Though a woman is reserved, and keeps her feelings concealed, yet when\n",
      "she gets on the top of a man, she then shows all her love and desire. A\n",
      "man should gather from the actions of the woman of what disposition she\n",
      "is, and in what way she likes to be enjoyed. A woman during her monthly\n",
      "courses, a woman who has been lately confined, and a fat woman should\n",

      "OF THE AUPARISHTAKA[39] OR MOUTH CONGRESS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two kinds of eunuchs, those that are disguised as males, and\n",
      "those that are disguised as females. Eunuchs disguised as females\n",
      "imitate their dress, speech, gestures, tenderness, timidity, simplicity,\n",
      "softness and bashfulness. The acts that are done on the jaghana or\n",
      "middle parts of women, are done in the mouths of these eunuchs, and this\n",
      "is called Auparishtaka. These eunuchs derive their imaginable pleasure,\n",
      "and their livelihood from this kind of congress, and they lead the life\n",
      "of courtezans. So much concerning eunuchs disguised as females.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eunuchs disguised as males keep their desires secret, and when they wish\n",
      "to do anything they lead the life of shampooers. Under the pretence of\n",
      "shampooing, an eunuch of this kind embraces and draws towards himself\n",
      "the thighs of the man whom he is shampooing, and after this he touches\n",
      "the joints of his thighs and his jaghana, or central portions of his\n",
      "body. Then, if he finds the lingam of the man erect, he presses it with\n",
      "his hands, and chaffs him for getting into that state. If after this,\n",
      "and after knowing his intention, the man does not tell the eunuch to\n",
      "proceed, then the latter does it of his own accord and begins the\n",
      "congress. If however he is ordered by the man to do it, then he disputes\n",
      "with him, and only consents at last with difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following eight things are then done by the eunuch one after the\n",
      "other, viz.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The nominal congress.\n",
      "   Biting the sides.\n",
      "   Pressing outside.\n",
      "   Pressing inside.\n",
      "   Kissing.\n",
      "   Rubbing.\n",
      "   Sucking a mangoe fruit.\n",
      "   Swallowing up.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of each of these the eunuch expresses his wish to stop, but\n",
      "when one of them is finished, the man desires him to do another, and\n",
      "after that is done, then the one that follows it, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). When, holding the man's lingam with his hand, and placing it\n",
      "between his lips, the eunuch moves about his mouth, it is called the\n",
      "\"nominal congress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When, covering the end of the lingam with his fingers collected\n",
      "together like the bud of a plant or flower, the eunuch presses the sides\n",
      "of it with his lips, using his teeth also, it is called \"biting the\n",
      "sides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When, being desired to proceed, the eunuch presses the end of the\n",
      "lingam with his lips closed together, and kisses it as if he were\n",
      "drawing it out, it is called the \"outside pressing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). When, being asked to go on, he put the lingam further into his\n",
      "mouth, and presses it with his lips and then takes it out, it is called\n",
      "the \"inside pressing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). When, holding the lingam in his hand, the eunuch kisses it as if he\n",
      "were kissing the lower lip, it is called \"kissing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(6). When, after kissing it, he touches it with his tongue everywhere,\n",
      "and passes the tongue over the end of it, it is called \"rubbing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(7). When, in the same way, he puts the half of it into his mouth, and\n",
      "forcibly kisses and sucks it, this is called \"sucking a mangoe fruit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(8). And lastly, when, with the consent of the man, the eunuch puts the\n",
      "whole lingam into his mouth, and presses it to the very end, as if he\n",
      "were going to swallow it up, it is called \"swallowing up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Striking, scratching, and other things may also be done during this kind\n",
      "of congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Auparishtaka is practised only by unchaste and wanton women, female\n",
      "attendants and serving maids, _i.e._, those who are not married to\n",
      "anybody, but who live by shampooing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Acharyas (_i.e._, ancient and venerable authors) are of opinion that\n",
      "this Auparishtaka is the work of a dog and not of a man, because it is a\n",
      "low practice, and opposed to the orders of the Holy Writ, and because\n",
      "the man himself suffers by bringing his lingam into contact with the\n",
      "mouths of eunuchs and women. But Vatsyayana says that the orders of the\n",
      "Holy Writ do not affect those who resort to courtezans, and the law\n",
      "prohibits the practice of the Auparishtaka with married women only. As\n",
      "regards the injury to the male, that can be easily remedied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of Eastern India do not resort to women who practise the\n",
      "Auparishtaka.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of Ahichhatra resort to such women, but do nothing with them,\n",
      "so far as the mouth is concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of Saketa do with these women every kind of mouth congress,\n",
      "while the people of Nagara do not practise this, but do every other\n",
      "thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of the Shurasena country, on the southern bank of the Jumna,\n",
      "do everything without any hesitation, for they say that women being\n",
      "naturally unclean, no one can be certain about their character, their\n",
      "purity, their conduct, their practices, their confidences, or their\n",
      "speech. They are not however on this account to be abandoned, because\n",
      "religious law, on the authority of which they are reckoned pure, lays\n",
      "down that the udder of a cow is clean at the time of milking, though the\n",
      "mouth of a cow, and also the mouth of her calf, are considered unclean\n",
      "by the Hindoos. Again a dog is clean when he seizes a deer in hunting,\n",
      "though food touched by a dog is otherwise considered very unclean. A\n",
      "bird is clean when it causes a fruit to fall from a tree by pecking at\n",
      "it, though things eaten by crows and other birds are considered unclean.\n",
      "And the mouth of a woman is clean for kissing and such like things at\n",
      "the time of sexual intercourse. Vatsyayana moreover thinks that in all\n",
      "these things connected with love, everybody should act according to the\n",
      "custom of his country, and his own inclination.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also the following verses on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The male servants of some men carry on the mouth congress with their\n",
      "masters. It is also practised by some citizens, who know each other\n",
      "well, among themselves. Some women of the harem, when they are amorous,\n",
      "do the acts of the mouth on the yonis of one another, and some men do\n",
      "the same thing with women. The way of doing this (_i.e._, of kissing the\n",
      "yoni) should be known from kissing the mouth. When a man and woman lie\n",
      "down in an inverted order, _i.e._, with the head of the one towards the\n",
      "feet of the other and carry on this congress, it is called the \"congress\n",
      "of a crow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the sake of such things courtezans abandon men possessed of good\n",
      "qualities, liberal and clever, and become attached to low persons, such\n",
      "as slaves and elephant drivers. The Auparishtaka, or mouth congress,\n",
      "should never be done by a learned Brahman, by a minister that carries on\n",
      "the business of a state, or by a man of good reputation, because though\n",
      "the practice is allowed by the Shastras, there is no reason why it\n",
      "should be carried on, and need only be practised in particular cases. As\n",
      "for instance, the taste, and the strength, and the digestive qualities\n",
      "of the flesh of dogs are mentioned in works on medicine, but it does not\n",
      "therefore follow that it should be eaten by the wise. In the same way\n",
      "there are some men, some places and some times, with respect to which\n",
      "these practices can be made use of. A man should therefore pay regard to\n",
      "the place, to the time, and to the practice which is to be carried out,\n",
      "as also as to whether it is agreeable to his nature and to himself, and\n",
      "then he may or may not practise these things according to circumstances.\n",
      "But after all, these things being done secretly, and the mind of the man\n",
      "being fickle, how can it be known what any person will do at any\n",
      "particular time and for any particular purpose.\n",

      "In the pleasure-room, decorated with flowers, and fragrant with\n",
      "perfumes, attended by his friends and servants, the citizen should\n",
      "receive the woman, who will come bathed and dressed, and will invite her\n",
      "to take refreshment and to drink freely. He should then seat her on his\n",
      "left side, and holding her hair, and touching also the end and knot of\n",
      "her garment, he should gently embrace her with his right arm. They\n",
      "should then carry on an amusing conversation on various subjects, and\n",
      "may also talk suggestively of things which would be considered as\n",
      "coarse, or not to be mentioned generally in society. They may then sing,\n",
      "either with or without gesticulations, and play on musical instruments,\n",

      "Such is the beginning of sexual union. At the end of the congress, the\n",
      "lovers with modesty, and not looking at each other, should go separately\n",
      "to the washing-room. After this, sitting in their own places, they\n",
      "should eat some betel leaves, and the citizen should apply with his own\n",
      "hand to the body of the woman some pure sandal wood ointment, or\n",
      "ointment of some other kind. He should then embrace her with his left\n",
      "arm, and with agreeable words should cause her to drink from a cup held\n",
      "in his own hand, or he may give her water to drink. They can then eat\n",

      "sugar, or anything that may be liked in different countries, and known\n",
      "to be sweet, soft, and pure. The lovers may also sit on the terrace of\n",

      "some time, come together with great difficulty, or when one of the two\n",
      "returns from a journey, or is reconciled after having been separated on\n",

      "is carried on according to the liking of the lovers, and as long as they\n",
      "choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). When two persons come together, while their love for each other is\n",
      "still in its infancy, their congress is called the \"congress of\n",
      "subsequent love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). When a man carries on the congress by exciting himself by means of\n",
      "the sixty-four ways, such as kissing, etc., etc., or when a man and a\n",
      "woman come together, though in reality they are both attached to\n",

      "love.\" At this time all the ways and means mentioned in the Kama Shastra\n",
      "should be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). When a man, from the beginning to the end of the congress, though\n",
      "having connection with the women, thinks all the time that he is\n",
      "enjoying another one whom he loves, it is called the \"congress of\n",
      "transferred love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). Congress between a man and a female water carrier, or a female\n",
      "servant of a caste lower than his own, lasting only until the desire is\n",
      "satisfied, is called \"congress like that of eunuchs.\" Here external\n",
      "touches, kisses, and manipulations are not to be employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6). The congress between a courtezan and a rustic, and that between\n",
      "citizens and the women of villages, and bordering countries, is called,\n",
      "\"deceitful congress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(7). The congress that takes place between two persons who are attached\n",
      "to one another, and which is done according to their own liking is\n",
      "called \"spontaneous congress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ends the kinds of congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall now speak of love quarrels.\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman who is very much in love with a man cannot bear to hear the name\n",
      "of her rival mentioned, or to have any conversation regarding her, or to\n",
      "be addressed by her name through mistake. If such takes place, a great\n",
      "quarrel arises, and the woman cries, becomes angry, tosses her hair\n",
      "about, strikes her lover, falls from her bed or seat, and, casting aside\n",
      "her garlands and ornaments, throws herself down on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time, the lover should attempt to reconcile her with\n",
      "conciliatory words, and should take her up carefully and place her on\n",
      "her bed. But she, not replying to his questions, and with increased\n",
      "anger, should bend down his head by pulling his hair, and having kicked\n",
      "him once, twice, or thrice on his arms, head, bosom or back, should then\n",
      "proceed to the door of the room. Dattaka says that she should then sit\n",
      "angrily near the door and shed tears, but should not go out, because she\n",
      "would be found fault with for going away. After a time, when she thinks\n",
      "that the conciliatory words and actions of her lover have reached their\n",
      "utmost, she should then embrace him, talking to him with harsh and\n",
      "reproachful words, but at the same time showing a loving desire for\n",
      "congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the woman is in her own house, and has quarrelled with her lover,\n",
      "she should go to him and show how angry she is, and leave him.\n",
      "Afterwards the citizen having sent the Vita,[41] the Vidushaka[41] or\n",
      "the Pithamurda[41] to pacify her, she should accompany them back to the\n",
      "house, and spend the night with her lover.\n",

      "A man, employing the sixty-four means mentioned by Babhravya, obtains\n",

      "divisions, no great respect is paid to him in the assembly of the\n",
      "learned. A man, devoid of other knowledge, but well acquainted with the\n",
      "sixty-four divisions, becomes a leader in any society of men and women.\n",
      "What man will not respect the sixty-four parts,[42] considering they are\n",
      "respected by the learned, by the cunning, and by the courtezans. As the\n",
      "sixty-four parts are respected, are charming, and add to the talent of\n",

      "affections upon a girl who is of good family, whose parents are alive,\n",

      "and thus create confidence in the girl. Some authors say that for the\n",
      "purpose of winning her over he should not speak to her for three days,\n",
      "but the followers of Babhravya are of opinion that if the man does not\n",
      "speak with her for three days, the girl may be discouraged by seeing him\n",
      "spiritless like a pillar, and, becoming dejected, she may begin to\n",
      "despise him as an eunuch. Vatsyayana says that the man should begin to\n",
      "win her over, and to create confidence in her, but should abstain at\n",
      "first from sexual pleasures. Women being of a tender nature, want tender\n",
      "beginnings, and when they are forcibly approached by men with whom they\n",
      "are but slightly acquainted, they sometimes suddenly become haters of\n",
      "sexual connection, and sometimes even haters of the male sex. The man\n",
      "should therefore approach the girl according to her liking, and should\n",
      "make use of those devices by which he may be able to establish himself\n",
      "more and more into her confidence. These devices are as follows:--\n",
      "\n",
      "He should embrace her first of all in a way she likes most, because it\n",
      "does not last for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He should embrace her with the upper part of his body because that is\n",
      "easier and simpler. If the girl is grown up, or if the man has known\n",
      "her for some time, he may embrace her by the light of a lamp, but if he\n",
      "is not well acquainted with her, or if she is a young girl, he should\n",
      "then embrace her in darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girl accepts the embrace, the man should put a \"tambula\" or\n",
      "screw of betel nut and betel leaves in her mouth, and if she will not\n",
      "take it, he should induce her to do so by conciliatory words,\n",
      "entreaties, oaths, and kneeling at her feet, for it is an universal rule\n",
      "that however bashful or angry a woman may be, she never disregards a man\n",
      "kneeling at her feet. At the time of giving this \"tambula\" he should\n",
      "kiss her mouth softly and gracefully without making any sound. When she\n",
      "is gained over in this respect he should then make her talk, and so that\n",
      "she may be induced to talk he should ask her questions about things of\n",
      "which he knows or pretends to know nothing, and which can be answered in\n",
      "a few words. If she does not speak to him, he should not frighten her,\n",
      "but should ask her the same thing again and again in a conciliatory\n",
      "manner. If she does not then speak he should urge her to give a reply,\n",
      "because as Ghotakamukha says, \"all girls hear everything said to them by\n",
      "men, but do not themselves sometimes say a single word.\" When she is\n",
      "thus importuned, the girl should give replies by shakes of the head, but\n",
      "if she quarrelled with the man she should not even do that. When she is\n",
      "asked by the man whether she wishes for him, and whether she likes him,\n",
      "she should remain silent for a long time, and when at last importuned to\n",
      "reply, should give him a favourable answer by a nod of the head. If the\n",
      "man is previously acquainted with the girl he should converse with her\n",
      "by means of a female friend, who may be favourable to him, and in the\n",
      "confidence of both, and carry on the conversation on both sides. On such\n",
      "an occasion the girl should smile with her head bent down, and if the\n",
      "female friend say more on her part than she was desired to do, she\n",
      "should chide her and dispute with her. The female friend should say in\n",
      "jest even what she is not desired to say by the girl, and add, \"she says\n",
      "so,\" on which the girl should say indistinctly and prettily, \"O no! I\n",
      "did not say so,\" and she should then smile and throw an occasional\n",
      "glance towards the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the girl is familiar with the man, she should place near him,\n",
      "without saying anything, the tambula, the ointment, or the garland that\n",
      "he may have asked for, or she may tie them up in his upper garment.\n",
      "While she is engaged in this, the man should touch her young breasts in\n",
      "the sounding way of pressing with the nails, and if she prevents him\n",
      "doing this he should say to her, \"I will not do it again if you will\n",
      "embrace me,\" and should in this way cause her to embrace him. While he\n",
      "is being embraced by her he should pass his hand repeatedly over and\n",
      "about her body. By and bye he should place her in his lap, and try more\n",
      "and more to gain her consent, and if she will not yield to him he should\n",
      "frighten her by saying, \"I shall impress marks of my teeth and nails on\n",
      "your lips and breasts, and then make similar marks on my own body, and\n",
      "shall tell my friends that you did them. What will you say then?\" In\n",
      "this and other ways, as fear and confidence are created in the minds of\n",
      "children, so should the man gain her over to his wishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the second and third nights, after her confidence has increased still\n",
      "more, he should feel the whole of her body with his hands, and kiss her\n",
      "all over; he should also place his hands upon her thighs and shampoo\n",
      "them, and if he succeed in this he should then shampoo the joints of her\n",
      "thighs. If she tries to prevent him doing this he should say to her,\n",
      "\"What harm is there in doing it?\" and should persuade her to let him do\n",
      "it. After gaining this point he should touch her private parts, should\n",
      "loosen her girdle and the knot of her dress, and turning up her lower\n",
      "garment should shampoo the joints of her naked thighs. Under various\n",
      "pretences he should do all these things, but he should not at that time\n",
      "begin actual congress. After this he should teach her the sixty-four\n",
      "arts, should tell her how much he loves her, and describe to her the\n",
      "hopes which he formerly entertained regarding her. He should also\n",
      "promise to be faithful to her in future, and should dispel all her fears\n",
      "with respect to rival women, and, at last, after having overcome her\n",
      "bashfulness, he should begin to enjoy her in a way so as not to frighten\n",
      "her. So much about creating confidence in the girl; and there are,\n",
      "moreover, some verses on the subject as follows:--\n",
      "\n",
      "A man acting according to the inclinations of a girl should try and gain\n",
      "her over so that she may love him and place her confidence in him. A\n",
      "man does not succeed either by implicitly following the inclination of a\n",
      "girl, or by wholly opposing her, and he should therefore adopt a middle\n",
      "course. He who knows how to make himself beloved by women, as well as to\n",
      "increase their honour and create confidence in them, this man becomes an\n",
      "object of their love. But he, who neglects a girl thinking she is too\n",
      "bashful, is despised by her as a beast ignorant of the working of the\n",
      "female mind. Moreover, a girl forcibly enjoyed by one who does not\n",
      "understand the hearts of girls becomes nervous, uneasy, and dejected,\n",
      "and suddenly begins to hate the man who has taken advantage of her; and\n",
      "then, when her love is not understood or returned, she sinks into\n",
      "despondency, and becomes either a hater of mankind altogether, or,\n",

      "Ancient authors are of opinion that girls are not so easily seduced by\n",
      "employing female messengers as by the efforts of the man himself, but\n",
      "that the wives of others are more easily got at by the aid of female\n",
      "messengers than by the personal efforts of a man. But Vatsyayana lays it\n",
      "down that whenever it is possible a man should always act himself in\n",
      "these matters, and it is only when such is impracticable, or impossible,\n",
      "that female messengers should be employed. As for the saying that women\n",
      "who act and talk boldly and freely are to be won by the personal efforts\n",
      "of the man, and that women who do not possess those qualities are to be\n",
      "got at by female messengers, it is only a matter of talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when a man acts himself in the matter he should first of all make\n",
      "the acquaintance of the woman he loves in the following manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "1st. He should arrange to be seen by the woman either on a natural or\n",
      "special opportunity. A natural opportunity is when one of them goes to\n",
      "the house of the other, and a special opportunity is when they meet\n",
      "either at the house of a friend, or a caste-fellow, or a minister, or a\n",
      "physician, as also on the occasion of marriage ceremonies, sacrifices,\n",
      "festivals, funerals, and garden parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd. When they do meet, the man should be careful to look at her in such\n",
      "a way as to cause the state of his mind to be made known to her; he\n",
      "should pull about his moustache, make a sound with his nails, cause his\n",
      "own ornaments to tinkle, bite his lower lip, and make various other\n",
      "signs of that description. When she is looking at him he should speak\n",
      "to his friends about her and other women, and should show to her his\n",
      "liberality and his appreciation of enjoyments. When sitting by the side\n",
      "of a female friend he should yawn and twist his body, contract his\n",
      "eyebrows, speak very slowly as if he were weary, and listen to her\n",
      "indifferently. A conversation having two meanings should also be carried\n",
      "on with a child or some other person, apparently having regard to a\n",
      "third person, but really having reference to the woman he loves, and in\n",
      "this way his love should be made manifest under the pretext of referring\n",
      "to others rather than to herself. He should make marks that have\n",
      "reference to her, on the earth with his nails, or with a stick, and\n",
      "should embrace and kiss a child in her presence, and give it the mixture\n",
      "of betel nut and betel leaves with his tongue, and press its chin with\n",
      "his fingers in a caressing way. All these things should be done at the\n",
      "proper time and in proper places.\n",
      "\n",
      "3rd. The man should fondle a child that may be sitting on her lap, and\n",
      "give it something to play with, and also take the same back again.\n",
      "Conversation with respect to the child may also be held with her, and in\n",
      "this manner he should gradually become well acquainted with her, and he\n",
      "should also make himself agreeable to her relations. Afterwards, this\n",
      "acquaintance should be made a pretext for visiting her house frequently,\n",
      "and on such occasions he should converse on the subject of love in her\n",
      "absence, but within her hearing. As his intimacy with her increases he\n",
      "should place in her charge some kind of deposit or trust, and take away\n",
      "from it a small portion at a time; or he may give her some fragrant\n",
      "substances, or betel nuts to be kept for him by her. After this he\n",
      "should endeavour to make her well acquainted with his own wife, and get\n",
      "them to carry on confidential conversations, and to sit together in\n",
      "lonely places. In order to see her frequently he should arrange that the\n",
      "same goldsmith, the same jeweller, the same basket maker, the same dyer,\n",
      "and the same washerman should be employed by the two families. And he\n",
      "should also pay her long visits openly under the pretence of being\n",
      "engaged with her on business, and one business should lead to another,\n",
      "so as to keep up the intercourse between them. Whenever she wants\n",
      "anything, or is in need of money, or wishes to acquire skill in one of\n",
      "the arts, he should cause her to understand that he is willing and able\n",
      "to do anything that she wants, to give her money, or teach her one of\n",
      "the arts, all these things being quite within his ability and power. In\n",
      "the same way he should hold discussions with her in company with other\n",
      "people, and they should talk of the doings and sayings of other persons,\n",
      "and examine different things, like jewellery, precious stones, etc. On\n",
      "such occasions he should show her certain things with the values of\n",
      "which she may be unacquainted, and if she begins to dispute with him\n",
      "about the things or their value, he should not contradict her, but point\n",
      "out that he agrees with her in every way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ends the ways of making the acquaintance of the woman desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now after a girl has become acquainted with the man as above described,\n",
      "and has manifested her love to him by the various outward signs; and by\n",
      "the motions of her body, the man should make every effort to gain her\n",
      "over. But as girls are not acquainted with sexual union, they should be\n",
      "treated with the greatest delicacy, and the man should proceed with\n",
      "considerable caution, though in the case of other women, accustomed to\n",
      "sexual intercourse, this is not necessary. When the intentions of the\n",
      "girl are known, and her bashfulness put aside, the man should begin to\n",
      "make use of her money, and an interchange of clothes, rings, and flowers\n",
      "should be made. In this the man should take particular care that the\n",
      "things given by him are handsome and valuable. He should moreover\n",
      "receive from her a mixture of betel nut and betel leaves, and when he is\n",
      "going to a party he should ask for the flower in her hair, or for the\n",
      "flower in her hand. If he himself gives her a flower it should be a\n",
      "sweet smelling one, and marked with marks made by his nails or teeth.\n",
      "With increasing assiduity he should dispel her fears, and by degrees get\n",
      "her to go with him to some lonely place, and there he should embrace and\n",
      "kiss her. And finally at the time of giving her some betel nut, or of\n",
      "receiving the same from her, or at the time of making an exchange of\n",
      "flowers, he should touch and press her private parts, thus bringing his\n",
      "efforts to a satisfactory conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man is endeavouring to seduce one woman, he should not attempt to\n",
      "seduce any other at the same time. But after he had succeeded with the\n",
      "first, and enjoyed her for a considerable time, he can keep her\n",
      "affections by giving her presents that she likes, and then commence\n",
      "making up to another woman. When a man sees the husband of a woman going\n",
      "to some place near his house, he should not enjoy the woman then, even\n",
      "though she may be easily gained over at that time. A wise man having a\n",

      "thing being done to her again. And what is done by the arm can also be\n",
      "done by the foot. If the man succeeds in this point he should embrace\n",
      "her more closely, and if she will not stand the embrace and gets up, but\n",

      "1. She calls out to a man without being addressed by him in the first\n",
      "instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. She shows herself to him in secret places.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. She speaks to him tremblingly and inarticulately.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. She has the fingers of her hand, and the toes of her feet moistened\n",
      "with perspiration, and her face blooming with delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. She occupies herself with shampooing his body and pressing his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. When shampooing him she works with one hand only, and with the other\n",
      "she touches and embraces parts of his body.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. She remains with both hands placed on his body motionless as if she\n",
      "had been surprised by something, or was overcome by fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. She sometimes bends down her face upon his thighs, and when asked to\n",
      "shampoo them does not manifest any unwillingness to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. She places one of her hands quite motionless on his body, and even\n",
      "though the man should press it between two members of his body, she does\n",
      "not remove it for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Lastly, when she has resisted all the efforts of the man to gain her\n",
      "over, she returns to him next day to shampoo his body as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a woman neither gives encouragement to a man, nor avoids him, but\n",
      "hides herself and remains in some lonely place, she must be got at by\n",
      "means of the female servant who may be near her. If when called by the\n",
      "man she acts in the same way, then she should be gained over by means of\n",
      "a skilful go-between. But if she will have nothing to say to the man, he\n",
      "should consider well about her before he begins any further attempts to\n",
      "gain her over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ends the examination of the state of a woman's mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man should first get himself introduced to a woman, and then carry on\n",
      "a conversation with her. He should give her hints of his love for her,\n",
      "and if he finds from her replies that she receives these hints\n",
      "favourably, he should then set to work to gain her over without any\n",
      "fear. A woman who shows her love by outward signs to the man at his\n",
      "first interview should be gained over very easily. In the same way a\n",
      "lascivious woman, who when addressed in loving words replies openly in\n",
      "words expressive of her love, should be considered to have been gained\n",
      "over at that very moment. With regard to all women, whether they be\n",

      "\n",
      "ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF A GO-BETWEEN.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If a woman has manifested her love or desire, either by signs or by\n",
      "motions of her body, and is afterwards rarely or never seen any where,\n",
      "or if a woman is met for the first time, the man should get a go-between\n",
      "to approach her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the go-between, having wheedled herself into the confidence of the\n",
      "woman by acting according to her disposition, should try to make her\n",
      "hate or despise her husband by holding artful conversations with her, by\n",
      "telling her about medicines for getting children, by talking to her\n",
      "about other people, by tales of various kinds, by stories about the\n",
      "wives of other men, and by praising her beauty, wisdom, generosity, and\n",
      "good nature, and then saying to her: \"It is indeed a pity that you, who\n",
      "are so excellent a woman in every way, should be possessed of a husband\n",
      "of this kind. Beautiful lady, he is not fit even to serve you.\" The\n",
      "go-between should further talk to the woman about the weakness of the\n",
      "passion of her husband, his jealousy, his roguery, his ingratitude, his\n",
      "aversion to enjoyments, his dullness, his meanness, and all the other\n",
      "faults that he may have, and with which she may be acquainted. She\n",
      "should particularly harp upon that fault or that failing by which the\n",
      "wife may appear to be the most affected. If the wife be a deer woman,\n",
      "and the husband a hare man, then there would be no fault in that\n",
      "direction, but in the event of his being a hare man, and she a mare\n",
      "woman or elephant woman, then this fault should be pointed out to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gonikaputra is of opinion that when it is the first affair of the woman,\n",
      "or when her love has only been very secretly shown, the man should then\n",
      "secure and send to her a go-between, with whom she may be already\n",
      "acquainted, and in whom she confides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to return to our subject. The go-between should tell the woman about\n",
      "the obedience and love of the man, and as her confidence and affection\n",
      "increase, she should then explain to her the thing to be accomplished in\n",
      "the following way. \"Hear this, Oh beautiful lady, that this man, born of\n",
      "a good family, having seen you, has gone mad on your account. The poor\n",
      "young man, who is tender by nature, has never been distressed in such a\n",
      "way before, and it is highly probable that he will succumb under his\n",
      "present affliction, and experience the pains of death.\" If the woman\n",
      "listens with a favourable ear, then on the following day the go-between,\n",
      "having observed marks of good spirits in her face, in her eyes, and in\n",
      "her manner of conversation, should again converse with her on the\n",
      "subject of the man, and should tell her the stories of Ahalya[59] and\n",
      "Indra, of Sakoontala[60] and Dushyanti, and such others as may be fitted\n",
      "for the occasion. She should also describe to her the strength of the\n",
      "man, his talents, his skill in the sixty-four sorts of enjoyments\n",
      "mentioned by Babhravya, his good looks, and his liaison with some\n",
      "praiseworthy woman, no matter whether this last ever took place or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to this, the go-between should carefully note the behaviour\n",
      "of the woman, which if favourable would be as follows: She would address\n",
      "her with a smiling look, would seat herself close beside her, and ask\n",
      "her, \"Where have you been? What have you been doing? Where did you dine?\n",
      "Where did you sleep? Where have you been sitting?\" Moreover the woman\n",
      "would meet the go-between in lonely places and tell her stories there,\n",
      "would yawn contemplatively, draw long sighs, give her presents, remember\n",
      "her on occasions of festivals, dismiss her with a wish to see her again,\n",
      "and say to her jestingly, \"Oh, well-speaking woman, why do you speak\n",
      "these bad words to me?\" would discourse on the sin of her union with the\n",
      "man, would not tell her about any previous visits or conversations that\n",
      "she may have had with him, but wish to be asked about these, and lastly\n",
      "would laugh at the man's desire, but would not reproach him in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ends the behaviour of the woman with the go-between.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the woman manifests her love in the manner above described, the\n",
      "go-between should increase it by bringing to her love tokens from the\n",
      "man. But if the woman be not acquainted with the man personally, the\n",
      "go-between should win her over by extolling and praising his good\n",
      "qualities, and by telling stories about his love for her. Here Auddalaka\n",
      "says that when a man or woman are not personally acquainted with each\n",
      "other, and have not shown each other any signs of affection, the\n",
      "employment of a go-between is useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "The followers of Babhravya on the other hand affirm that even though\n",
      "they be personally unacquainted, but have shown each other signs of\n",
      "affection there is an occasion for the employment of a go-between.\n",
      "Gonikaputra asserts that a go-between should be employed, provided they\n",
      "are acquainted with each other, even though no signs of affection may\n",
      "have passed between them. Vatsyayana however lays it down that even\n",
      "though they may not be personally acquainted with each other, and may\n",
      "not have shown each other any signs of affection, still they are both\n",
      "capable of placing confidence in a go-between.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the go-between should show the woman the presents, such as the betel\n",
      "nut and betel leaves, the perfumes, the flowers, and the rings which the\n",
      "man may have given to her for the sake of the woman, and on these\n",
      "presents should be impressed the marks of the man's teeth, and nails,\n",
      "and other signs. On the cloth that he may send he should draw with\n",
      "saffron both his hands joined together as if in earnest entreaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The go-between should also show to the woman ornamental figures of\n",
      "various kinds cut in leaves, together with ear ornaments, and chaplets\n",
      "made of flowers containing love letters expressive of the desire of the\n",
      "man,[61] and she should cause her to send affectionate presents to the\n",
      "man in return. After they have mutually accepted each other's presents,\n",
      "then a meeting should be arranged between them on the faith of the\n",
      "go-between.\n",
      "\n",
      "The followers of Babhravya say that this meeting should take place at\n",
      "the time of going to the temple of a Deity, or on occasions of fairs,\n",
      "garden parties, theatrical performances, marriages, sacrifices,\n",
      "festivals and funerals, as also at the time of going to the river to\n",
      "bathe, or at times of natural calamities,[62] fear of robbers or hostile\n",
      "invasions of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gonikaputra is of opinion however that these meetings had better be\n",
      "brought about in the abodes of female friends, mendicants, astrologers,\n",
      "and ascetics. But Vatsyayana decides that that place is only well suited\n",
      "for the purpose which has proper means of ingress and egress, and where\n",
      "arrangements have been made to prevent any accidental occurrence, and\n",
      "when a man who has once entered the house, can also leave it at the\n",
      "proper time without any disagreeable encounter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now go-betweens or female messengers are of the following different\n",
      "kinds, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). A go-between who takes upon herself the whole burden of the\n",
      "business.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). A go-between who does only a limited part of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). A go-between who is the bearer of a letter only.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). A go-between acting on her own account.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). The go-between of an innocent young woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6). A wife serving as a go-between.\n",
      "\n",
      "(7). A mute go-between.\n",
      "\n",
      "(8). A go-between who acts the part of the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). A woman who, having observed the mutual passion of a man and woman,\n",
      "brings them together and arranges it by the power of her own intellect,\n",
      "such an one is called a go-between who takes upon herself the whole\n",
      "burden of the business. This kind of go-between is chiefly employed when\n",
      "the man and the woman are already acquainted with each other, and have\n",
      "conversed together, and in such cases she is sent not only by the man\n",
      "(as is always done in all other cases) but by the woman also.--The above\n",
      "name is also given to a go-between who, perceiving that the man and the\n",
      "woman are suited to each other, tries to bring about a union between\n",
      "them, even though they be not acquainted with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). A go-between who, perceiving that some part of the affair is\n",
      "already done, or that the advances on the part of the man are already\n",
      "made, completes the rest of the business, is called a go-between who\n",
      "performs only a limited part of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). A go-between, who simply carries messages between a man and a\n",
      "woman, who love each other, but who cannot frequently meet, is called\n",
      "the bearer of a letter or message.\n",
      "\n",
      "This name is also given to one who is sent by either of the lovers to\n",
      "acquaint either the one or the other with the time and place of their\n",
      "meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). A woman who goes herself to a man, and tells him of her having\n",
      "enjoyed sexual union with him in a dream, and expresses her anger at his\n",
      "wife having rebuked him for calling her by the name of her rival instead\n",
      "of by her own name, and gives him something bearing the marks of her\n",
      "teeth and nails, and informs him that she knew she was formerly desired\n",
      "by him, and asks him privately whether she or his wife is the best\n",
      "looking, such a person is called a woman who is a go-between for\n",
      "herself. Now such a woman should be met and interviewed by the man in\n",
      "private and secretly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above name is also given to a woman who having made an agreement\n",
      "with some other woman to act as her go-between, gains over the man to\n",
      "herself, by the means of making him personally acquainted with herself,\n",
      "and thus causes the other woman to fail. The same applies to a man who,\n",
      "acting as a go-between for another, and having no previous connection\n",
      "with the woman, gains her over for himself, and thus causes the failure\n",
      "of the other man.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). A woman, who has gained the confidence of the innocent young wife\n",
      "of any man, and who has learned her secrets without exercising any\n",
      "pressure on her mind, and found out from her how her husband behaves to\n",
      "her, if this woman then teaches her the art of securing his favour, and\n",
      "decorates her so as to show her love, and instructs her how and when to\n",
      "be angry, or to pretend to be so, and then, having herself made marks of\n",
      "the nails and teeth on the body of the wife, gets the latter to send for\n",
      "her husband to show these marks to him, and thus excite him for\n",
      "enjoyment, such is called the go-between of an innocent young woman. In\n",
      "such cases the man should send replies to his wife through the same\n",
      "woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6). When a man gets his wife to gain the confidence of a woman whom he\n",
      "wants to enjoy, and to call on her and talk to her about the wisdom and\n",
      "ability of her husband, that wife is called a wife serving as a\n",
      "go-between. In this case the feelings of the woman with regard to the\n",
      "man should also be made known through the wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "(7). When any man sends a girl or a female servant to any woman under\n",
      "some pretext or other, and places a letter in her bouquet of flowers, or\n",
      "in her ear ornaments, or marks something about her with his teeth or\n",
      "nails, that girl or female servant is called a mute go-between. In this\n",
      "case the man should expect an answer from the woman through the same\n",
      "person.\n",
      "\n",
      "(8). A person, who carries a message to a woman, which has a double\n",
      "meaning, or which relates to some past transactions, or which is\n",
      "unintelligible to other people, is called a go-between who acts the part\n",
      "of the wind. In this case the reply should be asked for through the same\n",
      "woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus end the different kinds of go-betweens.\n",
      "\n",
      "A female astrologer, a female servant, a female beggar, or a female\n",
      "artist are well acquainted with the business of a go-between, and very\n",
      "soon gain the confidence of other women. Any one of them can raise\n",
      "enmity between any two persons if she wishes to do so, or extol the\n",
      "loveliness of any woman that she wishes to praise, or describe the arts\n",
      "practised by other women in sexual union. They can also speak highly of\n",
      "the love of a man, of his skill in sexual enjoyment, and of the desire\n",
      "of other women, more beautiful even than the woman they are addressing,\n",
      "for him, and explain the restraint under which he may be at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly a go-between can, by the artfulness of her conversation unite a\n",
      "woman with a man, even though he may not have been thought of by her, or\n",
      "may have been considered beyond his aspirations. She can also bring back\n",
      "a man to a woman, who, owing to some cause or other, has separated\n",
      "himself from her.\n",

      "and accost this woman when she sets out to go home, and induce her to\n",
      "come and see the amusing things in the palace. Previous to these\n",
      "festivals even, she should have caused it to be intimated to this woman\n",
      "that on the occasion of this festival she would show her all the\n",

      "the King desires, the wives of the King should get the wife to pay them\n",
      "a visit in the harem, and on this occasion a female attendant of the\n",
      "King, having been sent thither, should act as above described.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). Or, one of the King's wives should get acquainted with the woman\n",
      "that the King desires, by sending one of the female attendants to her,\n",
      "who should, on their becoming more intimate, induce her to come and see\n",
      "the royal abode. Afterwards, when she has visited the harem, and\n",
      "acquired confidence, a female confidante of the King, sent thither,\n",
      "should act as before described.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). Or, the King's wife should invite the woman, whom the King desires,\n",
      "to come to the royal palace, so that she might see the practice of the\n",
      "art in which the King's wife may be skilled, and after she has come to\n",
      "the harem, a female attendant of the King, sent thither, should act as\n",
      "before described.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). Or, a female beggar, in league with the King's wife, should say to\n",
      "the woman desired by the King, and whose husband may have lost his\n",
      "wealth, or may have some cause of fear from the King: \"This wife of the\n",
      "King has influence over him, and she is, moreover, naturally\n",
      "kind-hearted, we must therefore go to her in this matter. I shall\n",
      "arrange for your entrance into the harem, and she will do away with all\n",
      "cause of danger and fear from the King.\" If the woman accepts this\n",
      "offer, the female beggar should take her two or three times to the\n",
      "harem, and the King's wife there should give her a promise of\n",
      "protection. After this, when the woman, delighted with her reception and\n",
      "promise of protection, again goes to the harem, then a female attendant\n",
      "of the King, sent thither, should act as directed.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6). What has been said above regarding the wife of one who has some\n",
      "cause of fear from the King applies also to the wives of those who seek\n",
      "service under the King, or who are oppressed by the King's ministers, or\n",
      "who are poor, or who are not satisfied with their position, or who are\n",

      "who is not her husband, then the King should cause her to be arrested,\n",
      "and having made her a slave, on account of her crime, should place her\n",
      "in the harem. Or the King should cause his ambassador to quarrel with\n",
      "the husband of the woman desired by him, and should then imprison her as\n",

      "The women of the royal harem cannot see or meet any men on account of\n",
      "their being strictly guarded, neither do they have their desires\n",
      "satisfied, because their only husband is common to many wives. For this\n",

      "Some Kings, who are compassionate, take or apply certain medicines to\n",
      "enable them to enjoy many wives in one night, simply for the purpose of\n",
      "satisfying the desire of their women, though they perhaps have no desire\n",
      "of their own. Others enjoy with great affection only those wives that\n",
      "they particularly like, while others only take them according as the\n",
      "turn of each wife arrives in due course. Such are the ways of enjoyment\n",
      "prevalent in Eastern countries, and what is said about the means of\n",
      "enjoyment of the female is also applicable to the male.\n",
      "\n",
      "By means of their female attendants the ladies of the royal harem\n",
      "generally get men into their apartments in the disguise or dress of\n",
      "women. Their female attendants, and the daughters of their nurses, who\n",
      "are acquainted with their secrets, should exert themselves to get men to\n",
      "come to the harem in this way by telling them of the good fortune\n",
      "attending it, and by describing the facilities of entering and leaving\n",
      "the palace, the large size of the premises, the carelessness of the\n",
      "sentinels, and the irregularities of the attendants about the persons of\n",
      "the royal wives. But these women should never induce a man to enter the\n",
      "harem by telling him falsehoods, for that would probably lead to his\n",
      "destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the man himself, he had better not enter a royal harem, even\n",
      "though it may be easily accessible, on account of the numerous disasters\n",
      "to which he may be exposed there. If however he wants to enter it, he\n",
      "should first ascertain whether there is an easy way to get out, whether\n",
      "it is closely surrounded by the pleasure garden, whether it has separate\n",
      "enclosures belonging to it, whether the sentinels are careless, whether\n",
      "the King has gone abroad, and then, when he is called by the women of\n",
      "the harem, he should carefully observe the localities, and enter by the\n",
      "way pointed out by them. If he is able to manage it, he should hang\n",
      "about the harem every day, and, under some pretext or other, make\n",
      "friends with the sentinels, and show himself attached to the female\n",
      "attendants of the harem, who may have become acquainted with his design,\n",
      "and to whom he should express his regret at not being able to obtain the\n",
      "object of his desire. Lastly he should cause the whole business of a\n",

      "he should be careful to be able to recognize the emissaries of the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a go-between has no access to the harem, then the man should stand\n",
      "in some place where the lady, whom he loves, and whom he is anxious to\n",

      "\n",
      "If that place is occupied by the King's sentinels, he should then\n",
      "disguise himself as a female attendant of the lady who comes to the\n",
      "place, or passes by it. When she looks at him he should let her know his\n",
      "feelings by outward signs and gestures, and should show her pictures,\n",
      "things with double meanings, chaplets of flowers, and rings. He should\n",
      "carefully mark the answer she gives, whether by word or by sign, or by\n",
      "gesture, and should then try and get into the harem. If he is certain of\n",
      "her coming to some particular place he should conceal himself there, and\n",
      "at the appointed time should enter along with her as one of the guards.\n",
      "He may also go in and out, concealed in a folded bed, or bed covering,\n",
      "or with his body made invisible,[71] by means of external applications,\n",
      "a receipt for one of which is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart of an ichneumon, the fruit of the long gourd (Tumbi), and the\n",
      "eyes of the serpent, should all be burnt without letting out the smoke,\n",
      "the ashes should then be ground and mixed in equal quantities with\n",
      "water. By putting this mixture upon the eyes a man can go about unseen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other means of invisibility are prescribed by Duyana Brahmans and\n",
      "Jogashiras.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the man may enter the harem during the festival of the eight moon\n",
      "in the month of Nargashirsha, and during the moonlight festivals when\n",
      "the female attendants of the harem are all busily occupied, or in\n",
      "confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following principles are laid down on this subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrance of young men into harems, and their exit from them,\n",
      "generally take place when things are being brought into the palace, or\n",
      "when things are being taken out of it, or when drinking festivals are\n",
      "going on, or when the female attendants are in a hurry, or when the\n",
      "residence of some of the royal ladies is being changed, or when the\n",
      "King's wives go to gardens, or to fairs, or when they enter the palace\n",
      "on their return from them; or, lastly, when the King is absent on a long\n",
      "pilgrimage. The women of the royal harem know each other's secrets, and\n",
      "having but one object to attain, they give assistance to each other. A\n",
      "young man, who enjoys all of them, and who is common to them all, can\n",
      "continue enjoying his union with them so long as it is kept quiet, and\n",
      "is not known abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in the country of the Aparatakas the royal ladies are not well\n",
      "protected, and consequently many young men are passed into the harem by\n",
      "the women who have access to the royal palaces. The wives of the King of\n",
      "the Ahira country accomplish their objects with those sentinels in the\n",
      "harem who bear the name of Kashtriyas. The royal ladies in the country\n",
      "of the Vatsagulmas cause such men as are suitable to enter into the\n",
      "harem along with their female messengers. In the country of the\n",
      "Vaidarbhas the sons of the royal ladies enter the royal harem when they\n",
      "please, and enjoy the women, with the exception of their own mothers. In\n",
      "the Stri-rajya the wives of the King are enjoyed by his caste fellows\n",
      "and relations. In the Ganda country the royal wives are enjoyed by\n",
      "Brahmans, friends, servants, and slaves. In the Samdhava country,\n",
      "servants, foster children, and other persons like them enjoy the women\n",
      "of the harem. In the country of the Haimavatas adventurous citizens\n",
      "bribe the sentinels and enter the harem. In the country of the Vanyas\n",
      "and the Kalmyas, Brahmans, with the knowledge of the King, enter the\n",
      "harem under the pretence of giving flowers to the ladies, and speak with\n",
      "them from behind a curtain, and from such conversation union afterwards\n",
      "takes place. Lastly, the women in the harem of the King of the Prachyas\n",
      "conceal one young man in the harem for every batch of nine or ten of the\n",
      "women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus act the wives of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these reasons a man should guard his own wife. Old authors say that\n",
      "a King should select for sentinels in his harem such men as have their\n",
      "freedom from carnal desires well tested. But such men, though free\n",
      "themselves from carnal desire, by reason of their fear or avarice, may\n",
      "cause other persons to enter the harem, and therefore Gonikaputra says,\n",
      "that Kings should place such men in the harem as may have had their\n",
      "freedom from carnal desires, their fears, and their avarice well tested.\n",
      "Lastly, Vatsyayana says that under the influence of Dharma[72] people\n",
      "might be admitted, and therefore men should be selected who are free\n",
      "from carnal desires, fear, avarice, and Dharma.[73]\n",
      "\n",
      "The followers of Babhravya say that a man should cause his wife to\n",
      "associate with a young woman who would tell him the secrets of other\n",
      "people, and thus find out from her about his wife's chastity. But\n",
      "Vatsyayana says, that as wicked persons are always successful with\n",
      "women, a man should not cause his innocent wife to be corrupted by\n",
      "bringing her into the company of a deceitful woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are the causes of the destruction of a woman's chastity:\n",
      "\n",
      "Always going into society, and sitting in company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absence of restraint.\n",
      "\n",

      "This Part VI., about courtesans, was prepared by Vatsyayana, from a\n",
      "treatise on the subject, that was written by Dattaka, for the women of\n",
      "Pataliputra (the modern Patna), some two thousand years ago. Dattaka's\n",
      "work does not appear to be extant now, but this abridgement of it is\n",
      "very clever, and quite equal to any of the productions of Emile Zola,\n",
      "and other writers of the realistic school of to-day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a great deal has been written on the subject of the courtesan,\n",
      "nowhere will be found a better description of her, of her belongings, of\n",
      "her ideas, and of the working of her mind, than is contained in the\n",
      "following pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The details of the domestic and social life of the early Hindoos would\n",
      "not be complete without mention of the courtesan, and Part VI. is\n",
      "entirely devoted to this subject. The Hindoos have ever had the good\n",
      "sense to recognise courtesans as a part and portion of human society,\n",
      "and so long as they behaved themselves with decency and propriety, they\n",
      "were regarded with a certain respect. Anyhow, they have never been\n",
      "treated in the East with that brutality and contempt so common in the\n",
      "West, while their education has always been of a superior kind to that\n",
      "bestowed upon the rest of womankind in Oriental countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the earlier days the well-educated Hindoo dancing girl and courtesan\n",
      "doubtless resembled the Hetera of the Greeks, and being educated and\n",
      "amusing, were far more acceptable as companions than the generality of\n",
      "the married or unmarried women of that period. At all times and in all\n",
      "countries, there has ever been a little rivalry between the chaste and\n",
      "the unchaste. But while some women are born courtesans, and follow the\n",
      "instincts of their nature in every class of society, it has been truly\n",
      "said by some authors that every woman has got an inkling of the\n",

      "ABOUT RE-UNION WITH A FORMER LOVER.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When a courtesan abandons her present lover after all his wealth is\n",
      "exhausted, she may then consider about her re-union with a former lover.\n",
      "But she should return to him only if he has acquired fresh wealth, or is\n",
      "still wealthy, and if he is still attached to her. And if this man be\n",
      "living at the time with some other women she should consider well before\n",
      "she acts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now such a man can only be in one of the six following conditions, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "1st. He may have left the first woman of his own accord, and may even\n",
      "have left another woman since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd. He may have been driven away from both women.\n",
      "\n",
      "3rd. He may have left the one woman of his own accord, and be living\n",
      "with another woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "5th. He may have been driven away from the one woman, and left the other\n",
      "of his own accord.\n",
      "\n",
      "6th. He may have been driven away by the one woman, and may be living\n",
      "with another.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). Now if the man has left both women of his own accord, he should not\n",
      "be resorted to, on account of the fickleness of his mind, and his\n",
      "indifference to the excellencies of both of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). As regards the man who may have been driven away from both women,\n",
      "if he has been driven away from the last one because the woman could get\n",
      "more money from some other man, then he should be resorted to, for if\n",
      "attached to the first woman he would give her more money, through vanity\n",
      "and emulation to spite the other woman. But if he has been driven away\n",
      "by the woman on account of his poverty, or stinginess, he should not\n",
      "then be resorted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). In the case of the man who may have left the one woman of his own\n",
      "accord, and been driven away by the other, if he agrees to return to the\n",
      "former and give her plenty of money beforehand, then he should be\n",
      "resorted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). In the case of the man who may have left the one woman of his own\n",
      "accord, and be living with another woman, the former (wishing to take up\n",
      "with him again) should first ascertain if he left her in the first\n",
      "instance in the hope of finding some particular excellence in the other\n",
      "woman, and that not having found any such excellence, he was willing to\n",
      "come back to her, and to give her much money on account of his conduct,\n",
      "and on account of his affection still existing for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, whether, having discovered many faults in the other woman, he would\n",
      "now see even more excellences in herself than actually exist, and would\n",
      "be prepared to give her much money for these qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, lastly, to consider whether he was a weak man, or a man fond of\n",
      "enjoying many women, or one who liked a poor woman, or one who never did\n",
      "anything for the woman that he was with. After maturely considering all\n",
      "these things, she should resort to him or not, according to\n",
      "circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). As regards the man who may have been driven away from the one\n",
      "woman, and left the other of his own accord, the former woman (wishing\n",
      "to re-unite with him) should first ascertain whether he still has any\n",
      "affection for her, and would consequently spend much money upon her; or\n",
      "whether, being attached to her excellent qualities, he did not take\n",
      "delight in any other women; or whether, being driven away from her\n",
      "formerly before completely satisfying his sexual desires, he wished to\n",
      "get back to her, so as to be revenged for the injury done to him; or\n",
      "whether he wished to create confidence in her mind, and then take back\n",
      "from her the wealth which she formerly took from him, and finally\n",
      "destroy her; or, lastly, whether he wished first to separate her from\n",
      "her present lover, and then to break away from her himself. If, after\n",
      "considering all these things, she is of opinion that his intentions are\n",
      "really pure and honest, she can re-unite herself with him. But if his\n",
      "mind be at all tainted with evil intentions, he should be avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6). In the case of the man who may have been driven away by one\n",
      "woman, and be living with another, if the man makes overtures in return\n",
      "to the first one, the courtesan should consider well before she acts,\n",
      "and while the other woman is engaged in attracting him to herself, she\n",
      "should try in her turn (through keeping herself behind the scenes) to\n",
      "gain him over, on the grounds of any of the following considerations,\n",
      "viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "1st. That he was driven away unjustly and for no proper reason, and now\n",
      "that he has gone to another woman, every effort must be used to bring\n",
      "him back to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd. That if he were once to converse with me again, he would break away\n",
      "from the other woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "3rd. That the pride of my present lover would be put down by means of\n",
      "the former one.\n",
      "\n",
      "4th. That he has become wealthy, has secured a higher position, and\n",
      "holds a place of authority under the King.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "7th. That he lives apart from his father, or brother.\n",

      "rich man, who is now prevented from coming to me by my present lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "9th. That as he is not respected by his wife, I shall now be able to\n",
      "separate him from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "10th. That the friend of this man loves my rival, who hates me\n",
      "cordially; I shall, therefore, by this means separate the friend from\n",
      "his mistress.\n",
      "\n",
      "11th. And lastly, I shall bring discredit upon him by bringing him back\n",
      "to me, thus showing the fickleness of his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a courtesan is resolved to take up again with a former lover, her\n",
      "Pithamurda and other servants should tell him that his former expulsion\n",
      "from the woman's house was caused by the wickedness of her mother; that\n",
      "the woman loved him just as much as ever at that time, but could not\n",
      "help the occurrence on account of her deference to her mother's will;\n",
      "that she hated the union of her present lover, and disliked him\n",
      "excessively. In addition to this, they should create confidence in his\n",
      "mind by speaking to him of her former love for him, and should allude to\n",
      "the mark of that love that she has ever remembered. This mark of her\n",
      "love should be connected with some kind of pleasure that may have been\n",
      "practised by him, such as his way of kissing her, or manner of having\n",
      "connection with her.\n",

      "of opinion that the first one is preferable, because his disposition and\n",
      "character being already known by previous careful observation, he can be\n",
      "easily pleased and satisfied; but Vatsyayana thinks that a former lover,\n",
      "having already spent a great deal of his wealth, is not able or willing\n",
      "to give much money again, and is not, therefore, to be relied upon so\n",
      "much as a stranger. Particular cases may, however, arise differing from\n",

      "When a courtesan is able to realize much money every day, by reason of\n",
      "many customers, she should not confine herself to a single lover; under\n",
      "such circumstances, she should fix her rate for one night, after\n",

      "comparing her rates with those of other courtesans. She can inform her\n",

      "given to the one who would give her the kind of thing which she wants.\n",
      "But Vatsyayana says that the preference should be given to the one who\n",
      "gives her gold, because it cannot be taken back like some other things,\n",
      "it can be easily received, and is also the means of procuring anything\n",
      "that may be wished for. Of such things as gold, silver, copper, bell\n",

      "should be given to the generous lover, but Vatsyayana is of opinion that\n",
      "the one who is really attached to the courtesan should be preferred,\n",

      "(a). When by living with a great man a courtesan acquires present\n",
      "wealth, and in addition to this becomes acquainted with other people,\n",
      "and thus obtains a chance of future fortune, and an accession of wealth,\n",

      "called a gain of wealth not attended by any other gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c). When a courtesan receives money from other people besides her\n",
      "lover, the results are: the chance of the loss of future good from her\n",
      "present lover; the chance of disaffection of a man securely attached to\n",
      "her; the hatred of all; and the chance of a union with some low person,\n",
      "tending to destroy her future good. This gain is called a gain of wealth\n",
      "attended by losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d). When a courtesan, at her own expense, and without any results in\n",
      "the shape of gain, has connected with a great man, or an avaricious\n",
      "minister, for the sake of diverting some misfortune, or removing some\n",

      "is said to be a loss of wealth attended by gains of the future good\n",
      "which it may bring about.\n",
      "\n",
      "(e). When a courtesan is kind, even at her own expense, to a man who is\n",
      "very stingy, or to a man proud of his looks, or to an ungrateful man\n",
      "skilled in gaining the heart of others, without any good resulting from\n",
      "these connections to her in the end, this loss is called a loss of\n",
      "wealth not attended by any gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "(f). When a courtesan is kind to any such man as described above, but\n",
      "who in addition are favourites of the King, and moreover cruel and\n",
      "powerful, without any good result in the end, and with a chance of her\n",

      "(a). When a courtesan is not certain how much a man may give her, or\n",

      "abandoning a lover from whom she is unable to get money, she having\n",
      "taken all his wealth from him in the first instance, this doubt is\n",
      "called a doubt about religious merit.\n",

      "the next,[76] this doubt is called a doubt about the loss of a religious\n",
      "merit.\n",

      "(f). When a courtesan is uncertain as to whether she might create\n",

      "wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b). When a courtesan is requested by a friend, or is impelled by pity\n",
      "to have intercourse with a learned Brahman, a religious student, a\n",
      "sacrificer, a devotee, or an ascetic who may have all fallen in love\n",
      "with her, and who may be consequently at the point of death, by doing\n",
      "this she might either gain or lose religious merit, and therefore this\n",
      "is called a mixed doubt about the gain and loss of religious merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c). If a courtesan relies solely upon the report of other people (_i.e._,\n",
      "hearsay) about a man, and goes to him without ascertaining herself\n",
      "whether he possesses good qualities or not, she may either gain or lose\n",
      "pleasure in proportion as he may be good or bad, and therefore this is\n",
      "called a mixed doubt about the gain and loss of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "(a). If, when living with a lover, a courtesan gets both wealth and\n",
      "pleasure from him, it is called a gain on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b). When a courtesan lives with a lover at her own expense without\n",
      "getting any profit out of it, and the lover even takes back from her\n",
      "what he may have formerly given her, it is called a loss on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c). When a courtesan is uncertain whether a new acquaintance would\n",
      "become attached to her, and, moreover, if he became attached to her,\n",
      "whether he would give her any thing, it is then called a doubt on both\n",
      "sides about gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d). When a courtesan is uncertain whether a former enemy, if made up by\n",
      "her at her own expense, would do her some injury on account of his\n",
      "grudge against her; or, if becoming attached to her, would take away\n",

      "\n",

      "and also money from a man whom she may not go to see, this is called a\n",
      "gain on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b). When a courtesan has to incur further expense if she goes to see a\n",
      "man, and yet runs the risk of incurring an irremediable loss if she does\n",
      "not go to see him, this is called a loss on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c). When a courtesan is uncertain, whether a particular man would give\n",
      "her anything on her going to see him, without incurring expense on her\n",
      "part, or whether on her neglecting him another man would give her\n",
      "something, this is called a doubt on both sides about gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d.) When a courtesan is uncertain, whether, on going at her own expense\n",
      "to see an old enemy, he would take back from her what he may have given\n",
      "her, or whether by her not going to see him he would cause some disaster\n",

      "\n",

      "with her friends, should act so as to acquire gain, the chances of great\n",
      "gain, and the warding off of any great disaster. Religious merit and\n",

      "new combinations.\n",

      "When a courtesan consorts with men she should cause each of them to give\n",

      "(c). The oil of the hog weed, the echites putescens, the sarina plant,\n",
      "the yellow amaranth, and the leaf of the nymphæ, if applied to the body,\n",
      "has the same effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d). A black pigment from the same plants produce a similar effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "(e). By eating the powder of the nelumbrium speciosum, the blue lotus,\n",
      "and the mesna roxburghii, with ghee and honey, a man becomes lovely in\n",
      "the eyes of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "(f). The above things, together with the tabernamontana coronaria, and\n",
      "the xanthochymus pictorius, if used as an ointment, produce the same\n",
      "results.\n",
      "\n",
      "(g). If the bone of a peacock or of an hyena be covered with gold, and\n",
      "tied on the right hand, it makes a man lovely in the eyes of other\n",
      "people.\n",
      "\n",
      "(h). In the same way, if a bead, made of the seed of the jujube, or of\n",
      "the conch shell, be enchanted by the incantations mentioned in the\n",
      "Atharvana Veda, or by the incantations of those well skilled in the\n",
      "science of magic, and tied on the hand, it produces the same result as\n",
      "described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "(i). When a female attendant arrives at the age of puberty, her master\n",
      "should keep her secluded, and when men ardently desire her on account of\n",
      "her seclusion, and on account of the difficulty of approaching her, he\n",
      "should then bestow her hand on such a person as may endow her with\n",
      "wealth and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a means of increasing the loveliness of a person in the eyes of\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same way, when the daughter of a courtesan arrives at the age of\n",
      "puberty, the mother should get together a lot of young men of the same\n",
      "age, disposition, and knowledge as her daughter, and tell them that she\n",
      "would give her in marriage to the person who would give her presents of\n",
      "a particular kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this the daughter should be kept in seclusion as far as possible,\n",

      "been given to the daughter by the bridegroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, the mother may allow her daughter to be married to the man\n",
      "privately, as if she was ignorant of the whole affair, and then\n",

      "\n",
      "When the daughter of a courtesan is thus given to a man, the ties of\n",
      "marriage should be observed for one year, and after that she may do what\n",
      "she likes. But even after the end of the year, when otherwise engaged,\n",
      "if she should be now and then invited by her first husband to come and\n",

      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is the mode of temporary marriage among courtesans, and of\n",
      "increasing their loveliness, and their value in the eyes of others. What\n",

      "daughters of dancing women, whose mothers should give them only to such\n",
      "persons as are likely to become useful to them in various ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus end the ways of making oneself lovely in the eyes of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "(a). If a man, after anointing his lingam with a mixture of the powders\n",
      "of the white thorn apple, the long pepper, and the black pepper, and\n",
      "honey, engages in sexual union with a woman, he makes her subject to his\n",
      "will.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b). The application of a mixture of the leaf of the plant vatodbhranta,\n",
      "of the flowers thrown on a human corpse when carried out to be burnt,\n",
      "and the powder of the bones of the peacock, and of the jiwanjiva bird,\n",

      "\n",

      "powder, and mixed with cowach and honey, has also the same effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d). Anointing oneself with an ointment made of the plant emblica\n",
      "myrabolans has the power of subjecting women to one's will.\n",
      "\n",
      "(e). If a man cuts into small pieces the sprouts of the vajnasunhi\n",
      "plant, and dips them into a mixture of red arsenic and sulphur, and then\n",
      "dries them seven times, and applies this powder mixed with honey to his\n",
      "lingam, he can subjugate a woman to his will directly that he has had\n",
      "sexual union with her, or, if, by burning these very sprouts at night\n",
      "and looking at the smoke, he sees a golden moon behind, he will then be\n",
      "successful with any woman; or if he throws some of the powder of these\n",
      "same sprouts mixed with the excrement of a monkey upon a maiden, she\n",
      "will not be given in marriage to any body else.\n",
      "\n",
      "(f). If pieces of the arris root are dressed with the oil of the mango,\n",
      "and placed for six months in a hole made in the trunk of the sisu tree,\n",
      "and are then taken out and made up into an ointment, and applied to the\n",
      "lingam, this is said to serve as the means of subjugating women.\n",
      "\n",
      "(g). If the bone of a camel is dipped into the juice of the plant\n",
      "eclipta prostata, and then burnt, and the black pigment produced from\n",
      "its ashes is placed in a box also made of the bone of a camel, and\n",
      "applied together with antimony to the eye lashes with a pencil also made\n",
      "of the bone of a camel, then that pigment is said to be very pure, and\n",
      "wholesome for the eyes, and serves as a means of subjugating others to\n",
      "the person who uses it. The same effect can be produced by black pigment\n",
      "made of the bones of hawks, vultures, and peacocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus end the ways of subjugating others to one's own will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the means of increasing sexual vigour are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a). A man obtains sexual vigour by drinking milk mixed with sugar, the\n",
      "root of the uchchata plant, the piper chaba, and liquorice.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b). Drinking milk mixed with sugar, and having the testicle of a ram or\n",
      "a goat boiled in it, is also productive of vigour.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c). The drinking of the juice of the hedysarum gangeticum, the kuili,\n",
      "and the kshirika plant mixed with milk, produces the same effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d). The seed of the long pepper along with the seeds of the sanseviera\n",
      "roxburghiana, and the hedysarum gangeticum plant, all pounded together,\n",
      "and mixed with milk, is productive of a similar result.\n",
      "\n",
      "(e). According to ancient authors, if a man pounds the seeds or roots of\n",
      "the trapa bispinosa, the kasurika, the tuscan jasmine, and liquorice,\n",
      "together with the kshirakapoli (a kind of onion), and puts the powder\n",
      "into milk mixed with sugar and ghee, and having boiled the whole mixture\n",
      "on a moderate fire, drinks the paste so formed, he will be able to enjoy\n",
      "innumerable women.\n",
      "\n",
      "(f). In the same way, if a man mixes rice with the eggs of the sparrow,\n",
      "and having boiled this in milk, adds to it ghee and honey, and drinks as\n",
      "much of it as necessary, this will produce the same effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "(g). If a man takes the outer covering of sesamum seeds, and soaks them\n",
      "with the eggs of sparrows, and then, having boiled them in milk, mixed\n",
      "with sugar and ghee, along with the fruits of the trapa bispinosa and\n",
      "the kasurika plant, and adding to it the flour of wheat and beans, and\n",
      "then drinks this composition, he is said to be able to enjoy many women.\n",
      "\n",
      "(h). If ghee, honey, sugar, and liquorice in equal quantities, the juice\n",
      "of the fennel plant, and milk are mixed together, this nectar-like\n",
      "composition is said to be holy, and provocative of sexual vigour, a\n",
      "preservative of life, and sweet to the taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "(i). The drinking of a paste composed of the asparagus racemosus, the\n",
      "shvadaushtra plant, the guduchi plant, the long pepper, and liquorice,\n",
      "boiled in milk, honey, and ghee, in the spring, is said to have the same\n",
      "effect as the above.\n",
      "\n",
      "(j). Boiling the asparagus racemosus, and the shvadaushtra plant, along\n",
      "with the pounded fruits of the premna spinosa in water, and drinking the\n",
      "same, is said to act in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "(k). Drinking boiled ghee, or clarified butter in the morning during the\n",
      "spring season, is said to be beneficial to health and strength, and\n",
      "agreeable to the taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "(l). If the powder of the seed of the shvadaushtra plant and the flower\n",
      "of barley are mixed together in equal parts, and a portion of it, _i.e._,\n",
      "two palas in weight, is eaten every morning on getting up, it has the\n",
      "same effect as the preceding recipe.\n",

      "There are also verses on the subject as follows:\n",

      "\"The means[78] of producing love and sexual vigour should be learnt from\n",
      "the science of medicine, from the Vedas, from those who are learned in\n",

      "If a man is unable to satisfy a Hastini, or elephant woman, he should\n",
      "have recourse to various means to excite her passion. At the\n",
      "commencement he should rub her yoni with his hand or fingers, and not\n",
      "begin to have intercourse with her until she becomes excited, or\n",
      "experiences pleasure. This is one way of exciting a woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, he may make use of certain Apadravyas, or things which are put on or\n",
      "around the lingam to supplement its length or its thickness, so as to\n",
      "fit it to the yoni. In the opinion of Babhravya, these Apadravyas should\n",
      "be made of gold, silver, copper, iron, ivory, buffalo's horn, various\n",
      "kinds of wood, tin or lead, and should be soft, cool, provocative of\n",
      "sexual vigour, and well fitted to serve the intended purpose.\n",
      "Vatsyayana, however, says that they may be made according to the natural\n",
      "liking of each individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are the different kinds of Apadravyas.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1). \"The armlet\" (Valaya) should be of the same size as the lingam, and\n",
      "should have its outer surface made rough with globules.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2). \"The couple\" (Sanghati) is formed of two armlets.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3). \"The bracelet\" (Chudaka) is made by joining three or more armlets,\n",
      "until they come up to the required length of the lingam.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4). \"The single bracelet\" is formed by wrapping a single wire around\n",
      "the lingam, according to its dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5). The Kantuka or Jalaka is a tube open at both ends, with a hole\n",
      "through it, outwardly rough and studded with soft globules, and made to\n",
      "fit the side of the yoni, and tied to the waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "When such a thing cannot be obtained, then a tube made of the wood\n",
      "apple, or tubular stalk of the bottle gourd, or a reed made soft with\n",
      "oil and extracts of plants, and tied to the waist with strings, may be\n",
      "made use of, as also a row of soft pieces of wood tied together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above are the things that can be used in connection with or in the\n",
      "place of the lingam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of the southern countries think that true sexual pleasure\n",
      "cannot be obtained without perforating the lingam, and they therefore\n",
      "cause it to be pierced like the lobes of the ears of an infant pierced\n",
      "for earrings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when a young man perforates his lingam he should pierce it with a\n",
      "sharp instrument, and then stand in water so long as the blood continues\n",
      "to flow. At night he should engage in sexual intercourse, even with\n",
      "vigour, so as to clean the hole. After this he should continue to wash\n",
      "the hole with decoctions, and increase the size by putting into it small\n",
      "pieces of cane, and the wrightia antidysenterica, and thus gradually\n",
      "enlarging the orifice. It may also be washed with liquorice mixed with\n",
      "honey, and the size of the hole increased by the fruit stalks of the\n",
      "sima-patra plant. The hole should be annointed with a small quantity of\n",
      "oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hole made in the lingam a man may put Apadravyas of various\n",
      "forms, such as the \"round,\" the \"round on one side,\" the \"wooden\n",
      "mortar,\" the \"flower,\" the \"armlet,\" the \"bone of the heron,\" the \"goad\n",
      "of the elephant,\" the \"collection of eight balls,\" the \"lock of hair,\"\n",
      "the \"place where four roads meet,\" and other things named according to\n",
      "their forms and means of using them. All these Apadravyas should be\n",
      "rough on the outside according to their requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ways of enlarging the lingam must be now related.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man wishes to enlarge his lingam, he should rub it with the\n",
      "bristles of certain insects that live in trees, and then, after rubbing\n",
      "it for ten nights with oils, he should again rub it with the bristles as\n",
      "before. By continuing to do this a swelling will be gradually produced\n",
      "in the lingam, and he should then lie on a cot, and cause his lingam to\n",
      "hang down through a hole in the cot. After this he should take away all\n",
      "the pain from the swelling by using cool concoctions. The swelling,\n",
      "which is called \"Suka,\" and is often brought about among the people of\n",
      "the Dravida country, lasts for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the lingam is rubbed with the following things, viz., the plant\n",
      "physalis flexuosa, the shavara-kandaka plant, the jalasuka plant, the\n",
      "fruit of the egg plant, the butter of a she buffalo, the hastri-charma\n",
      "plant, and the juice of the vajra-rasa plant, a swelling lasting for one\n",
      "month will be produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "By rubbing it with oil boiled in the concoctions of the above things,\n",
      "the same effect will be produced, but lasting for six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enlargement of the lingam is also effected by rubbing it or\n",
      "moistening it with oil boiled on a moderate fire along with the seeds of\n",
      "the pomegranate, and the cucumber, the juices of the valuka plant, the\n",
      "hasti-charma plant, and the egg-plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the above, other means may be learnt from experienced and\n",
      "confidential persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The miscellaneous experiments and recipes are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a). If a man mixes the powder of the milk hedge plant, and the kantaka\n",
      "plant with the excrement of a monkey, and the powdered root of the\n",
      "lanjalalika plant, and throws this mixture on a woman, she will not love\n",
      "any body else afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b). If a man thickens the juice of the fruits of the cassia fistula,\n",
      "and the eugenia jambolana by mixing them with the powder of the soma\n",
      "plant, the vernonia anthelmintica, the eclipta prostata, and the\n",
      "lohopa-jihirka, and applies this composition to the yoni of a woman, and\n",
      "then has sexual intercourse with her, his love for her will be\n",
      "destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c). The same effect is produced if a man has connection with a woman\n",
      "who has bathed in the butter-milk of a she-buffalo mixed with the\n",
      "powders of the gopalika plant, the banu-padika plant, and the yellow\n",
      "amaranth.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d). An ointment made of the flowers of the nauclea cadamba, the hog\n",
      "plum, and the eugenia jambolana, and used by a woman, causes her to be\n",
      "disliked by her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "(e). Garlands made of the above flowers, when worn by the woman, produce\n",
      "the same effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "(f). An ointment made of the fruit of the asteracantha longifolia\n",
      "(kokilaksha) will contract the yoni of a Hastini or elephant woman, and\n",
      "this contraction lasts for one night.\n",
      "\n",
      "(g). An ointment made by pounding the roots of the nelumbrium speciosum,\n",
      "and of the blue lotus, and the powder of the plant physalis flexuosa\n",
      "mixed with ghee and honey, will enlarge the yoni of the Mrigi or deer\n",
      "woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "(h). An ointment made of the fruit of the emblica myrabolans soaked in\n",
      "the milky juice of the milk hedge plant, of the soma plant, the\n",
      "calotropis gigantea, and the juice of the fruit of the vernonia\n",
      "anthelmintica, will make the hair white.\n",
      "\n",
      "(i). The juice of the roots of the madayantaka plant, the yellow\n",
      "amaranth, the anjanika plant, the clitoria ternateea, and the\n",
      "shlakshnaparni plant, used as a lotion, will make the hair grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "(j). An ointment made by boiling the above roots in oil, and rubbed in,\n",
      "will make the hair black, and will also gradually restore hair that has\n",
      "fallen off.\n",
      "\n",
      "(k) If lac is saturated seven times in the sweat of the testicle of a\n",
      "white horse, and applied to a red lip, the lip will become white.\n",
      "\n",
      "(l). The colour of the lips can be regained by means of the madayantika\n",
      "and other plants mentioned above under (i).\n",
      "\n",
      "(m). A woman who hears a man playing on a reed pipe which has been\n",
      "dressed with the juices of the bahupadika plant, the tabernamontana\n",
      "coronaria, the costus speciosus or arabicus, the pinus deodora, the\n",
      "euphorbia antiquorum, the vajra and the kantaka plant, becomes his\n",
      "slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "(n). If food be mixed with the fruit of the thorn apple (Dathura) it\n",
      "causes intoxication.\n",
      "\n",
      "(o). If water be mixed with oil and the ashes of any kind of grass\n",
      "except the kusha grass, it becomes the colour of milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "(p). If yellow myrabolans, the hog plum, the shrawana plant, and the\n",
      "priyangu plant be all pounded together, and applied to iron pots, these\n",
      "pots become red.\n",
      "\n",
      "(q). If a lamp, trimmed with oil extracted from the shrawana and\n",
      "priyangn plants, its wick being made of cloth and the slough of the\n",
      "skins of snakes, is lighted, and long pieces of wood placed near it,\n",

      "CONCLUDING REMARKS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ends, in seven parts, the Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, which might\n",
      "otherwise be called a treatise on men and women, their mutual\n",
      "relationship, and connection with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a work that should be studied by all, both old and young; the\n",
      "former will find in it real truths, gathered by experience, and already\n",
      "tested by themselves, while the latter will derive the great advantage\n",
      "of learning things, which some perhaps may otherwise never learn at all,\n",
      "or which they may only learn when it is too late (\"too late\" those\n",
      "immortal words of Mirabeau) to profit by the learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can also be fairly commended to the student of social science and of\n",
      "humanity, and above all to the student of those early ideas, which have\n",
      "gradually filtered down through the sands of time, and which seem to\n",
      "prove that the human nature of to-day is much the same as the human\n",
      "nature of the long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been said of Balzac [the great, if not the greatest of French\n",
      "novelists] that he seemed to have inherited a natural and intuitive\n",
      "perception of the feelings of men and women, and has described them with\n",
      "an analysis worthy of a man of science. The author of the present work\n",
      "must also have had a considerable knowledge of the humanities. Many of\n",
      "his remarks are so full of simplicity and truth, that they have stood\n",
      "the test of time, and stand out still as clear and true as when they\n",
      "were first written, some eighteen hundred years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a collection of facts, told in plain and simple language, it must be\n",
      "remembered that in those early days there was apparently no idea of\n",
      "embellishing the work, either with a literary style, a flow of\n",
      "language, or a quantity of superfluous padding. The author tells the\n",
      "world what he knows in very concise language, without any attempt to\n",
      "produce an interesting story. From his facts how many novels could be\n",
      "written! Indeed much of the matter contained in parts III. IV. V. and\n",
      "VI., has formed the basis of many of the stories and the tales of past\n",
      "centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "There will be found in part VII., some curious recipes. Many of them\n",
      "appear to be as primitive as the book itself, but in later works of the\n",
      "same nature these recipes and prescriptions appear to have increased,\n",
      "both as regards quality and quantity. In the Anunga Runga or \"The Stage\n",
      "of Love,\" mentioned at page 5 of the Preface in Part I., there are found\n",
      "no less than thirty-three different subjects for which one hundred and\n",
      "thirty recipes and prescriptions are given.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the details may be interesting, these subjects are described as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For hastening the paroxysm of the woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For delaying the organs of the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Aphrodisiacs.\n",

      "4. For thickening and enlarging the lingam, rendering it sound and\n",
      "strong, hard and lusty.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. For narrowing and contracting the yoni.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. For perfuming the yoni.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. For removing and destroying the hair of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. For removing the sudden stopping of the monthly ailment.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. For abating the immoderate appearance of the monthly ailment.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. For purifying the womb.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. For causing pregnancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. For preventing miscarriage and other accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. For ensuring easy labour and ready deliverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. For limiting the number of children.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. For thickening and beautifying the hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. For obtaining a good black colour to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. For whitening and bleaching it.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. For renewing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. For clearing the skin of the face from eruptions that break out and\n",
      "leave black spots upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. For removing the black colour of the epidermis.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. For enlarging the breasts of women.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. For raising and hardening pendulous breasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "23. For giving a fragrance to the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "24. For removing the evil savour of perspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. For anointing the body after bathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "26. For causing a pleasant smell to the breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "27. Drugs and charms for the purposes of fascinating, overcoming, and\n",
      "subduing either men or women.\n",

      "28. Recipes for enabling a woman to attract and preserve her husband's\n",
      "love.\n",
      "\n",
      "29. Magical collyriums for winning love and friendship.\n",
      "\n",

      "32. Fascinating incense, or fumigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "33. Magical verses which have the power of fascination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the one hundred and thirty recipes given, many of them are absurd,\n",
      "but not more perhaps than many of the recipes and prescriptions in use\n",
      "in Europe not so very long ago. Love-philters, charms, and herbal\n",
      "remedies have been, in early days, as freely used in Europe as in Asia,\n",
      "and doubtless some people believe in them still in many places.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, one word about the author of the work, the good old sage\n",
      "Vatsyayana. It is much to be regretted that nothing can be discovered\n",
      "about his life, his belongings, and his surroundings. At the end of Part\n",
      "VII. he states that he wrote the work while leading the life of a\n",
      "religious student [probably at Benares] and while wholly engaged in the\n",
      "contemplation of the Deity. He must have arrived at a certain age at\n",
      "that time, for throughout he gives us the benefit of his experience, and\n",
      "of his opinions, and these bear the stamp of age rather than of youth;\n",
      "indeed the work could hardly have been written by a young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a beautiful verse of the Vedas of the Christians it has been said of\n",
      "the peaceful dead, that they rest from their labours, and that their\n",
      "works do follow them. Yes indeed, the works of men of genius do follow\n",
      "them, and remain as a lasting treasure. And though there may be\n",
      "disputes and discussions about the immortality of the body or the soul,\n",
      "nobody can deny the immortality of genius, which ever remains as a\n",
      "bright and guiding star to the struggling humanities of succeeding ages.\n",
      "This work, then, which has stood the test of centuries, has placed\n",
      "Vatsyayana among the immortals, and on This, and on Him no better elegy\n",
      "or eulogy can be written than the following lines:\n",
      "\n",
